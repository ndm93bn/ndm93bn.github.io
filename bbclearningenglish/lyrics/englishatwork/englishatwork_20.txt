1	(Introduction...)
4506	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome back to English at Work. Last time we heard Anna pitching her new plastic aubergine idea to Paul, in a lift.
14038	He was on his way to a biscuit-lovers' convention and didn't have much time.
19302	She gave the perfect elevator pitch but it's down to Paul to give her idea the go ahead â€“ the problem is, he seems to have gone missing.
29888	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Denise, isn't Paul supposed to be here today?
33812	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Yes. He went to that biscuit-lovers' convention yesterday but he said he'd be back today.
40888	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Maybe he's eloped with a pack of custard creams, eh?!
45000	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Very funny Tom. I'll give him a call now <em>â€¦</em>oh, that might be him now.
51333	Hello, Tip Top Tradingâ€¦ oh hello Paul, everything OK?
58501	oh no! oh no!
61538	<strong>Tom<br></strong>What Denise?
64000	<strong>Denise<br></strong>He choked on a biscuit at the convention and he's in hospital.
69666	<em>(To Paul)</em> Yes Paul, that was Tomâ€¦ you want to speak to Anna? I'll just get herâ€¦ get better soon Paul.
78100	<em>(To Anna)</em> Anna, Anna, it's Paul on the phone, he wants to speak to you â€“ sounds important.
86333	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Me? Oh right, can you transfer the call please? Hello Paul, are you OK?
96777	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Not really. Damn Garibaldi biscuit got wedged in my throat, ended up banging my head on a table trying to get it out.
105666	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh dear, so you're not coming to work today?
109444	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I'm afraid not, I need to rest for a few days so I was wondering, in fact I'm asking you, could you act up?
117888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I've told you before Paul, I can't actâ€¦ or even sing.
123300	<strong>Paul<br></strong>No, no Anna. Act up, I mean do my job for a bit â€“ be the boss â€“ just for a day or two.
131888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Me?! Be the boss?!
134500	<strong>Tom/Denise<br></strong>What?!
135900	<strong>Paul<br></strong>It's quite easy really. Just check my diary and you'll see what needs doing.
141800	And if you have any problems justâ€¦ ermâ€¦ just ask Denise. Thanks Anna<strong>.
147777	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>That's great Anna. You've got all the skills to do Paul's job â€“ maybe even more!
155198	But you need to take charge and show who's boss!
159000	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh right. But what should I say?
162888	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, don't be too bossy, but you could say: "If anyone has any issues about their work please come and speak to me", or, "I would like to have a meeting to discuss our work", or, "If there's anything you want to ask, my door is always open".
183000	That makes you sound like a very approachable boss! Good luck.
187737	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. Right everyone, as you know Paul has put me in charge for a while.
194888	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I'm not being funny Anna, but why you? I mean, I've been here the longest.
200929	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom, if you have any issues about your work, please come and speak to me.
205691	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh rightâ€¦ I will then.
208444	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Ermâ€¦ Annaâ€¦ congratulations on your promotion.
212508	I just wondered, now you're in charge, could I do a little less admin and a bit more selling?
219510	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Let's see Denise. I'd like to have a meeting soon to discuss all our work, so we can talk about it then. OK?
227999	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh yes, thanks Anna.
230455	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right then. It's business as usual and if there's anything you want to ask, my door is always open.
238666	Right, back to workâ€¦ and Tom, could I have a word in my office now please?
253111	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Excellent work Anna. You're sounding like the boss already â€“ just don't start eating biscuits!
259959	Being in charge means being firm but fair and keeping your cool. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases Anna used:
269089	<em>If anyone has any issues about their work please come and speak to me.
274888	<em>I would like to have a meeting to discuss our work.
278122	<em>If there is anything you want to ask, my door is always open.
287666	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Take a seat Tom. Could you please close the door?
291666	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I thought "your door was always open"?
295077	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Not this time. I need to speak to you about this message in Paul's diary.
300405	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh, right, I see. You need my help? What does it say?
304888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>It's for two days' time and it says, <em>Socrates, IPC, final</em>.
315547	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh no, that doesn't sound good.
319965	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear, what could that mean?
322526	Could there be trouble ahead?
324600	Join us again soon to find out. Bye.
