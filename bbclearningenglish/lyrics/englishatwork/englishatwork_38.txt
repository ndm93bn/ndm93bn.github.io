5700	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello again. At the offices of Tip Top Trading things are a bit strange after Tom walkedâ€¦ stormed out in a huff after realising that Anna was never going to marry him.
18999	So Anna, I suppose you can get on with being the manager now?
23439	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, I suppose so. But something's not right.
27444	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, you've lost a valuable member of your team.
30531	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I know, and a good friend too.
33666	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, you're the boss now â€“ it's time to deal with the situation and get down to business.
39499	Tell the team you'll be finding a replacement for Tom and you're going to make some changes in the office.
45670	You could also say you want to turn the business round and make it really successful.
51333	<strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, thanks. Excuse me everyone, could we gather round for a quick meeting please. Oh, it's just you now Denise.
63111	Right, well, I need to get down to business so I'll be advertising for a replacement for Tom today â€“ in fact Denise, you might be interested in that?
75111	And I want to make some changes in the office.
78555	I need to turn this business round and â€¦ make it the world's leading plastic fruit production company andâ€¦ I'mâ€¦ keen to hearâ€¦ your ideas.
90999	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Is everything alright?
93588	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Errâ€¦ I can't stop thinking about Tom.
97055	He seemed so upset when he left andâ€¦ it's not the same without him around.
103037	He made me laugh andâ€¦ I miss his floppy hair.
107277	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, it's time to swallow your pride!
110900	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Swallow what?
112488	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Admit you are wrong â€“ be honest with yourself and follow your heart â€“ go and marry Tom!
119178	Although personally, I don't know what you see in him.
122903	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You're right! Why didn't I see it?
126666	Tom is the man for me â€“ I must call him and find out where he is â€¦ oh no, his phone's switched off.
138300	Where can I find him?
140318	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Hey Anna. You looking for Tom?
143489	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes Mr Ingle, I am.
145666	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>I saw him a while ago, in a real rage, getting into a taxi.
150538	He told me he'd booked a flight to Australia and was heading for the airport.
156111	He said something about being a 'free spirit'.
162777	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Struth! Tom really is going too far â€“ to the other end of the world in fact.
169085	Does this mean we'll never hear from Tom again?
172277	For now, let's remind ourselves of some of the phrases Anna used to deal with a difficult situation:
179444	<em>I'll be advertising for a replacement for Tom today</em>
183999	<em>I want to make some changes in the office</em>
187927	<em>I need to turn this business round</em>
191009	<em>I'm keen to hear your ideas</em>
195888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>â€¦but work can wait. I've got to get to the airport quickly before Tom gets on that flight.
203335	Taxi! Taxi!
208106	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>This is going to be interesting!
