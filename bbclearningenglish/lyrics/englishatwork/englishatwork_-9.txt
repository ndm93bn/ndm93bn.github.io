1	(Introduction...)
3872	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome to the offices of Tip Top Trading. <br>(ongoing sound of annoying mobile phone ringtone)
7861	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna, are you going to answer that?
10766	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Er, well, no. It's stopped now anyway.
14444	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>... where Anna is behaving strangely. <br>(ringing starts again)
17439	<strong>Denise<br></strong>I gave you a long lesson on how to answer the phone and you're still too scared!
24047	<strong>Anna<br></strong>It's not that. <br>(desk phone starts ringing)
26100	<strong>Tom<br></strong>For goodness sake!
28291	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Then what?
29495	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I recognise the number - it's Mr Lime!
33418	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Ha! Old Slimy Limy, he must be absolutely desperate to get you to have lunch with him â€“ even after your cruel rejection.
43612	Here, I'll answer for you.
44998	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No!
45932	<strong>Denise<br></strong>I'll answer.
47341	Hello, Tip Top Trading, Anna's phone... no, this is Denise speaking, Anna's busy at the moment.
56939	Can I take a message? Yes... right.
63100	I'll pass that on to her thenâ€¦ thank you for calling. Goodbye.
68104	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well.
69374	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Nothing about lunch.
71386	He wants each Imperial Lemon you deliver to come in a luxury green box â€“ like the one you had at the presentation.
78757	<strong>Anna<br></strong>My goodness, we don't have many in stock, I'll have to order some.
83175	Erm.
86268	(dials a number) Hello, this is Anna speaking from Tip Top Trading, I want some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes.
96625	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Woah, woah, woah.
98949	<strong>Anna<br></strong>What?
99541	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Let's make this order a bit more politely okay?
103017	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Why are the English so obsessed with being polite!?
107430	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Calm down Anna and listen to me.
109768	To put in an order for something, you need phrases like:<br>I'd like to place an order for.
115674	<br>We're going to need.
117913	<br>Could you send.
119799	<br>Could we also have.
122410	<br>When can we expect to receive them?
125957	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right. Hello, sorry about that.
130523	I'd like to place an order for some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes, please.
136115	we're going to need quite a few... could you send 300 please... yes.
143530	the green ones... could we also have the name of our company on the sides.
148133	when can we expect to receive them... okay, thank you, goodbye.
155204	There! How was that?
157348	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Good, well done!
159149	<strong>Denise<br></strong>You'd better phone back Mr Lime to confirm he can have his boxes!
163134	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh no!
164852	<strong>Denise<br></strong>He's your client!
166555	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yes Anna, he's your client!
169439	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I'm scared he'll try and ask about lunch again.
173645	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Then send him an email.
175830	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Good idea!
176845	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Copy in me, Tom and Paul, so itâ€™s clear you only mean business only.
183230	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Thanks Denise! An email is much safer.
190006	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Is it, Anna, is it? Hmmm...
193799	<br>Anyway, here are the phrases Anna used to place her order: <br>I'd like to place an order for.
200887	We're going to need.
203448	Could you send.
205389	Could we also have.
207811	<When can we expect to receive them?
211296	Let's see if Anna's email is really such a good idea.
215085	I have a bad feeling about it. Until next time!
