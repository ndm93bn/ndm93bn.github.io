18522	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Come and have a biscuit in my office.
25356	Now Anna, about Mr Lime.
28739	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I didn't say yes!
30284	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Pardon? Yes to what?
32273	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, nothing.
33454	<strong>Paul<br></strong>You sent him an email yesterday and copied me in.

48086	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes: please could you confirm you want 300.
52304	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Right. Now that's not really the best way of writing an email to a client, is it?
58261	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh.
59370	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Please could you re-send your message to Mr Lime, using actual words that make sense.

80760	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Let me guess, Paul just spoke to you about your email?
84239	<strong>Anna<br></strong>How do you know?
85613	<strong>Tom<br></strong>You copied me in remember, I just read it â€“ or tried to.
89455	<strong>Anna<br></strong>But what's the problem? Other people write like that!
94073	<strong>Tom<br></strong>No, maybe some people write text messages like that in an SMS message on their phones, but that is completely the wrong style for an email to a client.
105454	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Okay Anna, let's stop listening to Tom, he's a waste of space.

136959	Denise?
138505	<strong>Denise<br></strong>(On the phone) yes. the other problem with Stephanie is that her legs are just too long.
145780	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, she's on the phone.
147644	<strong>Denise<br></strong>...yes, like trees.
150482	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I'll have to ask Tom. Tom?
152659	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Mm?
