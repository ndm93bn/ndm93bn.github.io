21111	But will she get there in time?
29222	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. Excuse me, do you know where the check in desks for flights to Sydney are?
37444	<strong>Man<br></strong>Yeah, over there luv – desk number 47.
41700	<strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, thanks.
48666	<strong>Tom<br></strong>… yeah, I always fly business class, it's the kind of guy I am… shame you're not available to fly with me but you know…
58333	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom, Tom!
60333	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna? How… what… what are you doing here?
65800	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Don't go… we need you… I need you.
69938	<strong>Tom<br></strong>But I don’t understand… you rejected me.
73999	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes but… but…
75999	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>But what Anna? What are you going to say?
80224	How can you tell him you were wrong and you've changed your mind?
84331	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Hmm, I don't know.
87111	<strong>Passenger 1<br></strong>Tell him 'I've been doing a lot of thinking'.
90500	<strong>Passenger 2<br></strong>Say, 'I didn't realise how much I missed you until you had gone'.
96915	<strong>Passenger 3<br></strong>And tell him, 'I've changed my mind, I will marry you!'
102333	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, yeah, I heard all that and that other man who you're always talking to.
107400	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh right!
108388	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I see. Well Tom, will you marry me?
113444	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Why should I after all you've put me through?
117444	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yeah why should he?
119600	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Because Tom… you're a funny guy and… I love you and… I can't live without you.
127111	<strong>Passengers<br></strong>Ahhh!
129888	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Let me think about this … oh if you put it like that then yes, I will marry you!
139400	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh Tom!
149666	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hooray. At last!
152277	We got there in the end but not without using these phrases:
156412	<em>I've been doing a lot of thinking.
159395	<em>I didn't realise how much I missed you until you had gone.
163639	<em>I've changed my mind, I will marry you!
167717	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>And…
169333	<em>I love you and I can't live without you!
176127	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I won't be needing these anymore.
181600	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Join us very soon for the English at Work wedding of the year. Bye!
