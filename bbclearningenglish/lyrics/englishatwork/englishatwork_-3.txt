1	(Introduction...)
5073	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome back. Things are quite tense at Tip Top Trading today.
9889	Paul, the boss, mistakenly thinks Anna's been smoking on company premises and she's trying to explain herself.
17350	<strong>Anna<br></strong>But, butâ€¦
17951	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Frankly, I'm disappointed with you Anna.
20294	You're a hard worker but it doesn't mean you can go against company policy.
24688	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, remember the phrases we've learnt about a misunderstanding!
29555	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh yes. Paul, I think there's been a misunderstanding.
33939	<strong>Paul<br></strong>A misunderstanding? How can you explain the smell of cigarette smoke?
38701	This is a 'no smoking' building.
40701	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Let me explain. I went down to the warehouse to speak to Mr Ingle andâ€¦ wellâ€¦ someone else was smoking.
49566	<strong>Paul<br></strong>What!? Someone was smoking in the warehouse?
52469	Golly gosh, that's highly dangerous. Who was it Anna?
56421	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Errâ€¦ wellâ€¦ I can't really say. But I dealt with it and it won't happen again.
63352	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yes, you dealt with it very well Anna but can you keep your secret about Mr Ingle safe?
69961	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Thank you Anna and sorry about the misunderstanding.
74396	Would you like a biscuit? Now I really think it's time we had a review of our health and safety procedures.
83108	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Denise, could you gather everyone round in the meeting room please.
86723	<strong>Denise<br></strong>(On phone) I'll have to call you back Marge.
89315	(Hangs up) Could you all gather in the meeting room please, Paul has something important to say.
95165	<strong>Tom<br></strong>What is it Denise? Is it about my fantastic sales figures again, huh?
99243	<strong>Denise<br></strong>I doubt it Tom. It sounded urgent. I'd better bring some tea.
105374	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Thank you for joining me. Unfortunately, there has been an incident in the warehouse.
111229	Someone has been smoking and I'm not happy, so I thought I would remind you of our health and safety procedures.
118726	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Not this again!
120410	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Your safety is our responsibility.
123727	But to keep safe we must follow some simple rules.
127092	Denise, what's the first one?
129144	<strong>Denise<br></strong>(Slurps tea) If you see a fire, raise the alarm â€“ oh and call the fire service.
136707	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, you love seeing those firemen, don't you, Denise!
140094	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Shhh Tom. Maybe you could tell us the other rule?
143406	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh yeah right. If you hear the fire alarm, get out quick.
148294	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Not exactly Tom.
150650	I think we should walk calmly to our nearest fire exit, following the green signs, go outside and meet at the fire assembly point.
159040	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Yes, and I will take a register of who is here, using my red pen (slurps tea).
165765	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Do you mind not slurping Denise?
168363	<strong>Denise<br></strong>This is thirsty work.
170933	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Hmm. Now is everyone clear about what to do if there is a fire alarm?
176742	<strong>Tom<br></strong>It's usually a false alarm anyway.
179287	<strong>Paul<br></strong>That's not the point. Now Anna, what about smoking?
183503	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No smoking on company premises. But it wasn't me, it was Mr Ingle.
189443	<strong>All<br></strong>Mr Ingle!
192914	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I see, so it was Mr Ingle smoking in the warehouse.
197784	You should have told me Anna.
199262	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Sorry!
200517	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Right, I'm going to have to look into this.
202784	Back to work everyoneâ€¦ oh and take a biscuit with you.
212864	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>So Anna's let the cat out of the bag â€“ Mr Ingle won't be pleased â€“ but at least she now knows what do if a fire breaks out.
221754	Here are some of the phrases we've heard today, that can be used in an emergency:<br>If you see a fire, raise the alarm.
230589	Walk calmly to your nearest fire exit.
233845	Meet at the fire assembly point.
236446	No smoking on company premises.
245698	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Sorry to interrupt Paulâ€¦ but the fire alarm's going off!
249410	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Don't panic anyone. Everything will be OK.
252824	(On phone) Jane, I'll have to call you backâ€¦ yes, a bit of a panic.
255861	Bye. Quick, where's my red pen?
258585	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Uh-oh. Those emergency phrases might come in useful sooner than you think.
263641	Is this going to be the end of Tip Top Trading, will it really go up in smoke?
268598	Find out next time. Bye.
