1	(Introduction...)
27900	<strong>Paul<br></strong>That behaviour just isn't on.
31111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Sorry Paulâ€¦ but it was quite funny wasn't it?
34666	<strong>Paul<br></strong>No it wasn't.
36466	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Sorry Paul, Tom was just angry with Dave.
40055	I thought he liked me but we saw him with Julie from accounts.
44666	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Really? He seemed such a decent chapâ€¦ anyway, don't do it again. OK?
51333	In the meantime, you're going to have to pay for that broken window.
55111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Whatâ€¦ hey? Bbbutâ€¦
57111	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Now, excuse me, I need to take this.
60099	Hello, Paul Smith speaking. Ah, Mr Socratesâ€¦ yesâ€¦ ah, you've heardâ€¦
68777	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Crikey, come on we'd better go.
73111	<strong>Denise<br></strong>That was a good shot Tom!
75666	Looks like it's made an impact on Dave.
78555	Look, he's sent Anna some flowers.
81777	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh there's a note on it.
83777	It says "You can count on me" but no name.
88333	<strong>Denise<br></strong>That is a strange thing for him to write.
91333	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Hmm, it is and it's not his handwriting.
95222	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Maybe a secret admirer eh? I wonder who it could be?
102054	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Are you OK Paul? You look as white as a sheet.
106444	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I'm not actually. Mr Socrates says he's having a <em>strategic review</em>.
114222	<strong>Anna<br></strong>A what?
115588	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>He means he's been looking at how the business is operating and how it should operate in the future.
122288	<strong>Anna<br></strong>That sounds serious.
124222	<strong>Paul<br></strong>And as part of his review, he says he wants to <em>downsize</em> and he's asked me toâ€¦ <em>step aside</em>.
135333	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Why? What are you in the way of?
138188	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>No Anna. To <em>step aside</em> is a polite way of saying to leave your position in the company.
144833	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh. I don't understand Paul. Why?
149999	<strong>Paul<br></strong>He says <em>the company needs new direction and more dynamic leadership</em>.
156777	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Crumbs Paul, you can't get more dynamic than you!
160900	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom! But Paul, you've been a great boss.
165222	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Thanks Anna. I guess it's the economic climate, we're not making enough money so cutting staff is inevitable.
173505	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah but you cut Denise's job.
176333	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Yes but we had to get her back because she was necessary for the smooth running of the department.
182055	<strong>Denise<br></strong>That's right.
183555	<strong>Paul<br></strong>But Mr Socrates says I'm '<em>surplus to requirement</em>'.
188753	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, that doesn't sound goodâ€¦ does it?
193110	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>If Paul's job is '<em>surplus to requirement</em>', it means his input to the business is no longer needed. So it's not good news.
202470	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Anyway Anna, Mr Socrates wants to know if you got his special message?
207944	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Special message? The flowers!?
211777	<strong>Denise<br></strong>That's strange. Why is Mr Socrates sending you flowers?
222444	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It is a bit strange. Anyway, Paul's news has come as a shock for everyone.
228289	Here are some of the phrases Mr Socrates used to break the bad news:
233999	<em>I've been doing a strategic review of the company.
238111	<em>I need to downsize.
240888	<em>I need you to step aside.
243894	<em>The company needs a new direction and more dynamic leadership.
248402	<em>You are surplus to requirement.
255111	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right, I'm going to have to call Mr Socrates and find out why he's sent me flowers.
262111	<strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Socratesâ€¦ who wants me?
264555	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Ermâ€¦ hello Mr Socratesâ€¦ it's Anna here.
268111	<strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Anna! My favourite girl. Please call me Brad. So glad you called.
272666	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I needed to speak to you about the flowers you sent me.
276282	I'm very flattered but I don't thinkâ€¦
278444	<strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>The flowers?! Sorry honey, I haven't sent you any flowers but I have sent you an email â€“ have you read it yet?
285000	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No. What did it say?
287111	<strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>I was saying that as I'm giving Paul the chop, would you like a promotion?
292111	<strong>Anna<br></strong>A promotion?
293333	<strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Yes. You have been an outstanding member of the team so how would you like to be the new manager of Tip Top Trading's London office?
301666	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>What a fantastic opportunity and one that Anna surely can't refuse â€“ or can she?
308424	And who did send Anna those flowers with a message saying "You can count on me"?
313722	Find out what her answer is in the next English at Work. Bye.
