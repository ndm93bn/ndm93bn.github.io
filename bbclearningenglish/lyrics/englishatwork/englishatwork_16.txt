1	(Introduction...)
6222	<strong>Waiter<br></strong>Would you like to see the menu?
8222	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh yes please.
10136	<strong>Waiter<br></strong>I was asking the lady actually.
12666	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh, right.
14618	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello again. Anna and Tom are finally on their dinner date at a pizza restaurant.
21400	Eating could be difficult for Tom because he's sprained his arm after that accident in the office.
27388	He might still have romance on his mind but Anna is thinking about something else. Are you feeling nervous Anna?
34990	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Nervous? Why?
37055	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Being out on your own with Tom. What are you going to talk about?
41312	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Don't worry. I can handle this, besides I want Tom's ideas about developing a new plastic vegetable.
48410	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>A plastic vegetable! Oh right. Well, good luck.
53903	<strong>Tom<br></strong>So, this is nice. Finally, us together, on our own, me and you, pizza, red wineâ€¦ expensive red wine, actually.
66555	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Lovely, Tom. You know Tom, Paul wants me to develop a new idea â€“ plastic vegetables â€“ I thought, maybe, you might like to help me?
78216	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Come on Anna, we're not here to talk business. Tell me about you â€“ the real Anna.
84700	Have you had manyâ€¦ err, many boyfriends before?
88200	<strong>Anna<br></strong>That's a bit personal. What do you think about plastic peas?
92999	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Err? Can you not switch off from work for one minute?
98555	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom. I think you and me are very similar â€“ we're a good team.
104444	If we could come up with a great idea for Paul then who knowsâ€¦ we may get to travel the world selling it together?
112179	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh, I see. I hadn't thought of it like that. Right wellâ€¦
118333	<strong>Waiter<br></strong>Your pizzasâ€¦ madamâ€¦ sir.
121735	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. Tom, I think you'll need some help cutting that.
127923	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Thanks. Mmm, you smell niceâ€¦ or is that the pizza?
137837	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I've got it!
139075	<strong>Tom<br></strong>What?
140521	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Plastic aubergines!
143027	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Plastic aubergines?
145040	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Plastic aubergines. They would look great on this table â€“ a sort of decoration.
153888	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah! And you could put sauces insideâ€¦ or salt and pepper.
160666	You could be on to something here.
162784	<strong>Anna<br></strong>We need to put a proposal together, to give it to Paul. But what should we say?
169200	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, your proposal needs to be brief but clear. Use positive language to propose your idea to Paul.
177481	Use words like '<em>exceptional</em>', '<em>fantastic</em>', '<em>quality</em>', and talk about how it would benefit the business by using words like '<em>profit</em>', '<em>efficiency</em>', and '<em>value for money</em>'. Good luck!
193002	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Are you OK Anna?
195101	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Just writing some things down.
197903	<strong>Tom<br></strong>OK, well write down how we could target restaurants and cafes.
204028	They'll be begging for our vegetables. Oh this is so excitingâ€¦ let's drink to ourâ€¦ succâ€¦ Oh!
211319	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom! What have you done? You've knocked red wine all over meâ€¦ and my notebook.
217236	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Ermm, sorry. We had better get you out of that dress.
229000	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hmm, what a mess and what a date!
232748	But what may be lacking in romance is made up for in a potentially successful business deal.
239409	Let's find out how it's going much much later at Tom's flatâ€¦
244847	<strong>Anna<br></strong>â€¦this <em>exceptional</em> product has <em>fantastic</em> potentialâ€¦
249506	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Say 'demand for this plastic aubergine will reach melting point!' My little joke.
256211	<strong>Anna<br></strong>â€¦by making the production more <em>efficient</em>, our customers will get <em>value for money</em> and our <em>profits</em> will increase. There, done.
266156	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Great. We can pitch this to Paul first thing on Monday morning.
270479	So now, maybe we can get back to our date? Look I saved some of that pizza.
276100	<strong>Anna<br></strong>It's all cold! Anyway, I had better go.
280427	It's late and I want to tidy up this proposal.
283708	But it's been great. I can't wait till next time.
286900	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Bbbutâ€¦Next time?
292900	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, that went well!
295034	The pizza may be cold but Anna and Tom have developed a red hot proposal.
300395	Here's a reminder of some of the words you might want to use to make your business proposal stand outâ€¦
306723	<em>Exceptional!
308422	<em>Fantastic!
309674	<em>Quality.
310700	<em>Profit.
311700	<em>Efficiency.
312783	<em>Value for money.
314081	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>So with the proposal written, Tom and Anna just need to convince Paul â€“ and that means pitching their idea.
321800	Find out how they get on next time. Bye for now.
