1	(Introduction...)
28222	<strong>Paul<br></strong>So Anna, Iâ€™m sorry Tom didn't tell you but do you think you can turn something round by Friday?
34555	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I'll try, but what do I need to do?
38555	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh not much, book a room somewhere, send out some invitesâ€¦ arrange some foodâ€¦ and drinkâ€¦ that sort of thing.
47155	<strong>Anna<br></strong>That's all?!
48333	<strong>Paul<br></strong>You can do it - you're great at this kind of thing. And get the team to help.
53520	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, I'll give it a go. See you later.
57222	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Thanks Anna. And don't forget to order some of those posh Belgian chocolate biscuits, they always go down well with the clients.
65999	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear Anna. It looks like you have your work cut out.
70555	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Cut out?
71888	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>I mean, you have a difficult job to do - but as Paul says, you can do it.
78100	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks.
79222	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Are you OK Anna? You look a bit worried.
83452	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I am. You forgot to tell me about the product launch on Friday and now Paul wants me to organise it.
90666	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Did I? Oh sorry. Look, if I can help in any way, just let me know.
96640	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, you could book a venue for the launch.
100111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Ahh yeahâ€¦ just remembered, I've got some Imperial Lemons I need to send out. Maybe later, yeah?
108999	<strong>Anna<br></strong>How am I going to find a venue for the launch at such short notice?
116304	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>You need to ask for recommendations, search on the internet, or look in the phone directory, and then make a call.
123222	You need to say "Could I check availability for your venue please?",
128075	then ask "What business facilities do you have?"
131808	and "How many people can the room or venue hold?"
136155	You could ask "Can you provide hospitality?" â€“ thatâ€™s things like food and drink.
142111	Finally, don't forget to ask "How much does it cost?"
146050	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks, there's a lot to ask.
148728	Hi Denise, I've got to book a venue for our plastic aubergine launch.
153900	Have you any ideas?
155555	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Well, my friend Marge works for a hotel company that has conference facilities.
161222	You could give her a call. Look, here's her number.
165111	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, thanks Denise. Let's give it a tryâ€¦ 0â€“2â€“0â€“7â€“5â€“6â€“9â€“2.
178333	<strong>Marge<br></strong>Hello, the Pitz Hotel. Margery speaking.
182444	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hi, this is Anna from Tip Top Trading, I'm a friend of Denise's.
187555	<strong>Marge<br></strong>Oh hi Anna. I've heard all about you.
190888	What are you ringing for?
192883	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I need to check availability for your venue for a product launch weâ€™re doing.
197888	<strong>Marge<br></strong>Right! Well, I'm sure I can help.
200441	We do have a conference room. When is it for?
203777	<strong>Anna<br></strong>This Friday.
205350	<strong>Marge<br></strong>Friday! This Friday?
207431	Wellâ€¦ that's a bit tricky: the room is being decorated at the moment.
212222	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh.
212915	<strong>Marge<br></strong>But we do have a smaller room that you could use â€“ it's got a lovely view of the car park.
219888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I seeâ€¦ and how many people does it hold?
224111	<strong>Marge<br></strong>You could easily squeeze in about 20 people.
227777	<strong>Anna<br></strong>20 people. I guess it will have to do.
231797	Do you have any business facilities â€“ somewhere to plug in the laptop, projector, wi-fi, that sort of thing?
239533	<strong>Marge<br></strong>Oh yes, yes, we're very hi-tech. We even have a fax machine!
244222	<strong>Anna<br></strong>And can you provide hospitality too?
246999	<strong>Marge<br></strong>Of course! We do a 'business platter' consisting of orange juice, sandwiches, canapĂ©s â€“ that really means cheese and pineapple on sticks.
256000	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I wonder, can you also provide Belgian chocolate biscuits?
260999	<strong>Marge<br></strong>I'm sure we can.
262090	<strong>Anna<br></strong>That's great! OKâ€¦ and most importantly, how much does it cost?
267222	<strong>Marge<br></strong>Well, to book the room for 2 hours usually costs Â£1,000.
272733	The hospitality is extra but as you're a friend of Denise, I'll throw it in for nothing.
278888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You'll throw the food and drink in?! Won't that get messy?
283169	<strong>Marge<br></strong>No - I mean we'll provide it for free. Just don't tell anyone, otherwise everyone will expect it!
293100	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, that's fantastic Marge. Thanks.
296555	If you can send us an invoice, we'll sort payment out as soon as possible.
301222	<strong>Marge<br></strong>Bye Anna, and tell Denise I'll see her for our Zumba class tomorrow.
308777	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna has saved the day again. The launch party for the plastic aubergine can now go ahead.
315538	If you're trying to book a venue for a business meeting or product launch, here are some of the phrases you could use:
322777	<em>Could I check availability for your venue please?
326333	<em>What business facilities do you have?
329239	<em>How many people can the room or venue hold?
332810	<em>Can you provide hospitality?
335666	<em>How much does it cost?
343777	<strong>Denise<br></strong>So Anna, was Marge any help?
346888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. She found me a room and gave me a good deal.
351055	We just need to invite our clients now.
353444	<strong>Denise<br></strong>I can do that. I think itâ€™s best if I call them - there's no time to post out invitations.
359955	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Good idea.
361023	<strong>Denise<br></strong>But I just need to give Marge a call first, just to check a few things.
366000	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Typical Denise. Nothing's more urgent than talking to Marge!
370641	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>He can talk! If you need something doing it seems like Anna is the woman you need.
376795	Find out what else she is capable of in the next episode of English at Work. Bye!
