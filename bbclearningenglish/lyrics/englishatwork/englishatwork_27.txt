1	(Introduction...)
3900	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Has anyone seen the stapler?
6403	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>I can't find any pens.
8450	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>Oh, here it is.
10333	<strong>Paul</strong><strong><br></strong>Will someone answer that phone?
13200	<strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br></strong>Hello again and welcome back to English at Work.
17625	The offices of Tip Top Trading have become chaotic since Denise left and just at a time when things are getting busy.
25800	How is everyone going to cope? Let's find out.
34347	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>Hello. Yes? It is... We're very busy at the moment so call back later. Bye.
41111	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>That was a bit rude Tom.
43055	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>Well we're too busy to be nice.
45400	<strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br></strong>Hmm...Not a good attitude Tom. Even when you are busy at work it's important to be polite on the phone.
53263	It could be a potential customer. Anna, I think you're going to have to remind Tom about this.
60110	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>Yes, I think so.
61684	<strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br></strong>If things are busy in the office you could say to someone on the phone 'we're a bit busy at the moment, could I take your name and number and we'll call you back'?
71819	And, 'when would be a convenient time to call you?'
75888	or if the caller wants to speak to someone specific you could say 'could I take a message please and I'll make sure he or she calls you back?'
86500	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>That's useful. Oh there goes the phone again.
90164	<strong>Paul</strong><strong><br></strong>Anna, could you get that please? I've got a mouthful of biscuit. Thanks.
96999	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>Sure Paul. Hello? Tip Top Tradingâ€¦ yes, that's rightâ€¦ but things are a bit busy at the moment.
106400	Could I take your name and number and I'll call you back as soon as I canâ€¦ oh hold on, has anyone got a pen?
113333	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>I think we've run out. Denise usually orders them.
117000	Here, use my souvenir pen I bought in Italy, you see it changes colour if you hold it up to the light.
124000	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>Thanks. Oh no! There's no paper to write it on.
128555	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>Here, write it on my hand.
130800	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>OK. Hold still. 7-4-9-0-5-6-8.
140981	Thanks for your patience, when is a good time to call you back?
144897	â€¦ OKâ€¦ 3 o'clockâ€¦ I'll call you then. Goodbye.
148999	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>Sounds important.
150666	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>Possibly. Oh not again! Hello, Tip Top Trading, Anna speakingâ€¦ I seeâ€¦ Well he doesn't seem to be here at the momentâ€¦ can I take a message and I'll get him to call you back?
166504	Tom, I need your other hand to write onâ€¦ keep still. OK, what's the message?
173666	â€¦ Yes, call Bob about the lemons on 8-0-9-5-2-4. OK, I'll pass that on. Thanks. Bye.
186777	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>Goodness. It's been crazy here since Denise left.
191030	Look we've even run out of teabags. I'll go and get some, shall I?
195900	<strong>Paul</strong><strong><br></strong>Hold on Tom. Has that invoice for Tutti Fruity been sent out yet?
200555	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>I dunno. Denise usually sends out the paperwork.
203800	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>I wish Denise was here!
205999	<strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br></strong>So do we all! It sounds like chaos in the office but however hectic things can get, remember to remain professional when answering the phone.
216100	Here's a reminder of some of the phrases you could useâ€¦
220000	<em>We're a bit busy at the moment; could I take your name and number and we'll call you back?
225800	<em>When would be a convenient time to call you?
228777	<em>Could I take a message please and I'll make sure he or she calls you back?
242444	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>Ah there you are, Tom, you've been a long time. I need to give Paul that important message I wrote on your hand.
249222	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>Ahâ€¦ yesâ€¦ it's a bit tricky. You see, I went to the toilet and then Iâ€¦ washed my hands.
261225	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>Oh no, you've washed the messages off! What are we going to do now?
266555	<strong>Tom</strong><strong><br></strong>Ermâ€¦ I'll get that, shall I?
268361	<strong>Anna</strong><strong><br></strong>We can't carry on like this.
270555	<strong>Narrator</strong><strong><br></strong>No you can't! Has Anna lost the numbers of two potential clients?
276000	Can the company carry on like this? It certainly looks like it could do with another pair of hands.
282018	What will happen next? Join us again next time for English at Work. Bye!
