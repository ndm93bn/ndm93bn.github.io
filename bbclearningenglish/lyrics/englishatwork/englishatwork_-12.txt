5196	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello. We're back at Tip Top Trading.
8135	Anna is very busy dealing with Mr Lime's big order for Imperial Lemons.
13707	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes? Who?
17260	I can't hear you.
19677	Mr what? What?
22832	Mr Who? I don't know, you tell me.
27288	Oh, you are Mr Hu. H-U: Hu.
32603	Er... No, Tom's busy.
35041	Call back later. Bye. Tom, Mr Hu called you.
39326	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Mr Hu-
40735	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Mr Hu: H-U
45131	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna, Mr Hu is a very important
49824	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh! What now?! Yes?
55690	<strong>Tom<br></strong>(to himself) I'm going to have to talk to the boss about this.
58793	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No. I'm busy, give me your number, I'll call you later.
63475	Yep, yep, 6...8... thanks. Bye!
67323	Right, now where was I?
70423	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna, could I have a word?
73548	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Ohhh, he must want to tell me how pleased he is with the Citrus Ventures deal.
79056	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Now, Anna. biscuit?
82101	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you.
82830	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I'm a little bit concerned about something.
86097	<strong>Anna<br></strong>"I'm a little bit concerned." Doesn't that mean something bad?
91758	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yes, Anna, Paul is using a polite turn of phrase to say he is unhappy about something.
98167	Let's see what he's got to say.
100915	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I think you need to work on your telephone manner.
103959	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Work on my telephone manner?
107724	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It means the way you talk on the phone is not good enough and you have to improve it â€“ to work on it to make it better.
115522	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Perhaps you should think about â€¦
118084	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Perhaps you should think about â€“ that's a polite way of telling you to do something!
123725	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna, are you listening to me?
126346	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, sorry, I was just sort of, err, talking to myself.
130077	Could you repeat what you said please?
132688	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Right, I'll start again.
135057	I said: I'm a little bit concerned about your telephone manner.
140453	You need to work on the way you speak to clients.
143234	Perhaps you should think about being a bit more polite to clients; it's important for the image of the company.
149476	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh okay.
151037	<strong>Paul<br></strong>You can go now â€“ take another biscuit with you â€“ that's my last chocolate wafer, you lucky thing!
159024	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Anna? Is everything all right?
164435	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes.
166696	<strong>Denise<br></strong>What's the matter?
168657	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Paul says I need to w-w-w-work on my telephone manner.
174844	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Well I was a bit concerned about it myself.
179156	And I think Tom actually mentioned it to Paul.
182417	But, look, I'll help you if you like.
188905	I'm a bit of an expert on the phone. I'll give you some lessons.
193654	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh thank you.
195235	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Come in early tomorrow morning, before the others get here and we'll practise.
201091	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you Denise, that's very kind.
205415	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Wow! Denise is actually being nice to Anna.
208812	Amazing! Although from what I've heard of Denise on the phone, she's only ever gossiping with friends.
215537	Paul was very gentle and polite in the way he explained to Anna there was a problem and that she needed to improve some things.
222736	He used these phrases: <br>I'm a little bit concerned about.
227244	You need to work on.
228803	Perhaps you should think about.
231345	Let's see if Denise manages to teach Anna anything useful next time.
236395	Until then!
