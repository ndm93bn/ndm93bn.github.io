1	(Introduction)
11111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Quick, gather round, here she comes.
17888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Welcome back Denise, we just couldn't survive without you.
22444	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh bless you.
24222	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yes welcome back to Tip Top Trading Denise.
27950	Paul, the boss, was a little hasty in getting rid of her so now he's asked her back but negotiated some new conditions which include learning how to be a Sales Executive, like Anna.
40613	But who's going to show her what to do?
44777	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh, hello Denise. Nice to have you back.
49400	I suppose I had to eat my words didn't I?
53100	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Yes, well it makes a change from biscuits!
57410	Now, where have you put my stapler and my red pens?
61444	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Don't worry about that, I've got you a new stapler and a new desk, right here next to Anna.
70555	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh lovely.
72444	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Well you wanted some experience in sales, so I thought Anna could show you the ropes.
78179	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Ropes? I don't have any ropes!
81240	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, if you 'show someone the ropes' it means you explain to someone how to do the job.
88200	You'll be great at that.
89964	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh I see. Well I might know what to do but I'm no good at explaining it to someone else.
98200	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well the best way is to start at the beginning.
101666	Why not suggest to her to 'watch what I do', or give her some of your tasks and say 'please could you make a start on these?'
110526	and then reassure her by saying 'I'm here to help so please ask me if you need to know what to do.' Good luck.
119000	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks! So Denise, it's nice to have you back, how's your new desk?
124821	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Much bigger than my old one â€“ and look, it goes upâ€¦.and down.
130900	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes it does. OK, shall we make a start then and I'll show you the ropes.
136777	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh yes Anna, of course Anna. Do I need to use the phone?
140888	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I reckon you're quite experienced with the phone already Denise!
144743	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you Tom. We won't make any calls yet, just watch what I do for a while.
150111	Look, I'm just checking our database so see who we haven't called for a while.
155342	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh yes.
156888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I'm just checking the dates hereâ€¦in fact Denise, why don't you make a start on this.
164099	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Of courseâ€¦oh look, my phone's ringing.
169111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Are you going to answer it then?
171444	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh right. Hello, Tip Top Trading, Denise speakingâ€¦oh hello Marge!
180999	<em>(To Anna)</em> It's Marge, Anna!
182444	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh right. I'll leave you to it â€“ I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do.
189622	<strong>Denise<br></strong>OK Anna, I won't be long. So Marge, how did it go the other night?
196261	Really? Really! Well, I'm sitting at my new deskâ€¦
202222	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Nice to have her back hey?! Some Sales Exec she's going to be!
210111	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Everyone has to start somewhere Tom!
212660	Now Anna is helping â€“ or coaching - Denise I'm sure she'll become an excellent worker.
218600	Here are some of the phrases Anna used to help her:
222666	<em>Let me show you the ropes.
224999	<em>Watch what I do for a while.
227576	<em>Why don't you make a start on this?
230576	<em>I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do.
238888	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Let's find out how Denise is getting on.
242333	<strong>Denise<br></strong>So I said to him, it's just not my colourâ€¦yes exactlyâ€¦hold on Marge, everyone's looking at me.
253903	I'd better call you back. Yes, tonight. Bye!
258666	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Hmm, you've certainly got a good phone manner.
262000	Do you think you could order some pens now, we've run out.
265000	<strong>Denise<br></strong>That's not my responsibility anymore.
268381	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Err, I think it is.
270300	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Isn't!
271100	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Is.
272000	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Isn't!
272800	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You two, please!
274500	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Well, she's got time for personal calls but not to order pens.
278666	Oh hold onâ€¦.Oh Hi Jim, how's things? Did you catch the match last night? What a goal!
