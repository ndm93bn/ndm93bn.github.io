1	(Introduction...)
5333	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello again and welcome back to the final English at Work.
9732	Mr Socrates has sacked Paul from his position as manager of Tip Top Trading and he's offered Anna a promotion â€“ to be the new boss.
20000	But will she accept? What's wrong Anna?
23300	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I feel bad about replacing Paul. He's been good to me.
27333	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It's business Anna. He's just not up to the job â€“ but you are.
32333	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. But why me? Can I do the job?
36570	I'm not as experienced as Tom.
38914	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>I think we have seen over the year that you definitely have more experience than Tom!
44622	Go on Anna, you can do it.
46888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Hmmm.
47812	<strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>So Annaâ€¦ what do you say? Will you replace Paul as the new boss of Tip Top Trading?
53555	Come on Anna. This promotion recognises your achievements at the company. It's an opportunity of a lifetime.
59900	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I know.
61183	<strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>You'll be my right-hand man.
63335	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>I think he means right-hand woman! It means you'd be his most trusted and invaluable assistant.
70400	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I see.
71848	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, if you need time to think you could say "thank you for your kind words" and, "could I have time to consider your offer?"
81336	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Erm, Mr Socrates. This news has come as a bit of a shock.
86466	Thank you for your kind words but please could I have some time to consider your offer?
92300	<strong>Mr Socrates<br></strong>Ohâ€¦ OK Anna. But don't leave it too long.
96888	I have a habit of changing my mind.
98710	<strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, Mr Socratesâ€¦ I mean Bradâ€¦ I'll call you back soon. Bye.
104444	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Ohâ€¦ has Mr S offered you Paul's job by any chance?
108500	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes!
109396	<strong>Tom<br></strong>And you said you'd think about it?
111777	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. I'm not sure if I can take on that much responsibility.
115500	<strong>Tom<br></strong>It's easy peasy. I could do it standing on my head.
119522	<strong>Denise<br></strong>But he's not offeringÂ­ you the job Tom.
122059	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Please don't mention this to Paulâ€¦ not yetâ€¦ he's very upset.
127400	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I know nothing!
128956	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You know nothing? About what?
131555	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I mean, I'll remain tight lippedâ€¦ I won't say a wordâ€¦ until it's all official like. You can count on me.
140777	<strong>Anna<br></strong>"You can count on me"!?
143300	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Uh?
144106	<strong>Anna<br></strong>"You can count on me".
146666	That was the message with that that bunch of flowers someone sent me.
151101	It was you wasn't it?!
153000	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Wellâ€¦ errâ€¦ I supposeâ€¦ yesâ€¦ it was me Anna.
158886	I couldn't help it. Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ love you Anna.
163115	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Do you know what Tomâ€¦ I quite like you tooâ€¦ I think you'reâ€¦ sweet<em>.</em>
169666	Now come on and give me a kiss.
173333	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh crumbs, shall I come back later?!
176700	<strong>Tom<br></strong>No it's ok Paul. Weâ€™re justâ€¦ getting to know each other a bit better.
181900	In fact, Annaâ€¦ I'd like to ask you something.
185666	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh, why is Tom getting down on one knee?
189777	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I expect he's dropped one of his contact lenses.
192914	<strong>Tom<br></strong>No it's not that. Anna, I'd like to ask you somethingâ€¦ errâ€¦ will youâ€¦ will you marry me?
201825	<strong>Anna<br></strong>What?!
206822	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Crikey, what a dilemma. Now Anna's got two important questions to answer.
213300	Will she take the job as Tip Top Trading's newest and youngest manager? And will she marry Tom?
220444	Here's a reminder of what Mr Socrates had to say about her:
224888	<em>This promotion recognises your achievements at the company.
228646	<em>It's an opportunity of a lifetime.
231999	<em>You would be my right-hand man.
235100	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>And if Anna accepts the job, here's what she could say:
239666	<em>I'd be delighted to accept. Thank you.
243368	<em>When would I start?
245555	<em>Could we discuss the terms and conditions of the new job?
253666	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Let's find out what Anna has to say.
256380	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh Tom, I don't know what to say.
259999	It's come as a bit of a shock. Can I have some time to think about it?
264055	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I suppose.
267017	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Well, while you think about that, I've got some good news. I've been offered a new job.
273888	<strong>Denise<br></strong>That's fantastic news Paul. What is it?
277962	<strong>Paul<br></strong>It's to be Head Taster at a company called Better Biscuits.
282999	<strong>Anna<br></strong>That's fantastic news Paul.
285111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, well done Paul. That's right up your street.
288716	<strong>Denise<br></strong>So Anna, does that mean you'll do Paulâ€™s job now?
293111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Don't answer that. Answer my proposal first.
297100	<strong>Denise<br></strong>No, I think she should sort out her work first.
300111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>But I've been waiting to ask her for months.
304888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Quiet! Look everyone, I can't decide what to say to you Tom, or Mr Socrates.
312444	So I've decided I'm going to take a short holiday to have some time to think.
317555	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Good idea. Where shall we go?
319888	<strong>Anna<br></strong>On my own Tom. When I return I will give you my answers.
324111	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Crumbs. I think I'd better get a biscuit.
328888	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>A good idea Anna. But weâ€™re going to have to wait a while to find out what she decides.
335084	She needs a rest after learning so much during her year at Tip Top Trading.
340888	We hope you've enjoyed learning with her and now feel more confident in using English at work!
347426	Thatâ€™s all from me and the team at Tip Top Trading for now.
351171	Until we meet again, bye!
