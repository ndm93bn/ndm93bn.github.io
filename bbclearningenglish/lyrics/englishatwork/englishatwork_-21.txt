5395	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome back to English at Work.
7920	We're still in Anna's first week in the busy offices of Tip Top Trading.
13282	How's it going Anna?
14928	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Everything's still so new to me.
17624	I keep needing to ask people for help!
20479	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, that's only natural at the beginning.
23068	To ask people politely for help use the words would and could.
28467	You can also use the word please, but don't make the mistake of thinking's enough to make what you say polite.
37070	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Er, ok.
41220	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Hello Anna!
42241	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hi, Paul!
44034	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I was wondering if you could do something for me?
46721	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes of course.
47851	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Would you be able to print out a file for me?
49998	It's a document on CBL â€“ Convincing Bananas Limited â€“ they're one of our suppliers.
56424	The file should<br>be on the system and could I have it in the next ten minutes please, as&nbsp;they're on their way here for a meeting?
63008	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Oh no, I've no idea how to find it! Tom.?!
69236	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Er, ask Denise. She should know.
72765	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Ok, thanks Tom, I'll ask her.
79315	<strong>Denise<br></strong>(on the phone to Sharon) I'd warned her, you know, I said 'Victoria, if you&nbsp;don't change your hairdresser
84309	<strong>Anna</strong><br>Denise?
84825	<strong>Denise<br></strong>One day you'llâ€¦ hold on a moment. Anna?
89047	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Please email me the background file on CBL.
92257	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Er!
93439	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you.
94434	<strong>Denise<br></strong>(on the phone) Who does that girl think she is?
97685	Anna. new girl. I told you about her. yes with the saucepans, that's the one.
105224	She's only been<br>here five minutes and she's already acting like the Queen of Sheba.
111428	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh and Denise, please send it to me within five minutes, Paul needs it soon. Thank you.
118233	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Really!
120001	<strong>Tom<br></strong>He he, good to see who's the boss, eh Denise?
123413	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Really!
124937	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Er, Anna, I think you've upset Denise.?
128679	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Upset Denise?
130517	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>You were a bit rude when you asked her to help.
133024	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Was I?
133911	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Remember what I said Anna.
136107	Just using â€˜pleaseâ€™ to ask someone to do&nbsp;something can sound a little rude.
141323	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh.
142251	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Instead of saying 'Please send me the file' you could say 'Could you&nbsp;possibly send me the file?'
148792	or 'Would you mind sending me the file?'
152110	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh! English is so confusing! I'll try to remember that.
157295	Oh no, the printer isn't even set up! Tom?
161893	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah?
162765	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Please help me withâ€¦I mean, could you possibly help me with the printer?
167848	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Er. I need to finish this email to a really important new client.
174430	<strong>Anna<br></strong>But it's really urgent.
177297	Would you mind writing your email later?
180199	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Okay, since you asked so nicely. Let's have a look.
184828	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, it's a good thing Anna has understood how to use 'could' and 'would'&nbsp;to ask for things, before she upsets anyone else.
195133	Let's hear those phrases again:
197065	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I was wondering if you could do something for me?
200339	Would you be able to print out a file for me?
204059	Could I have it within ten minutes please?
207463	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Could you possibly help me with the printer?
210687	Would you mind writing your email later?
213710	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>The printer seems to be working well, but how well are Anna and Denise working together?
221782	Are these two going to be enemies?
224501	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Really!
225447	'Denise do this! Denise do that!'
227851	I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost had enough!
230611	I get treated like I'm some kind of servant!
