4606	<strong>Anna<br></strong>(On the phone) Yes, we have plenty in stock.
8089	They're Â£4 per unitâ€¦ They are good quality onesâ€¦
14095	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>The company in France that Anna called earlier has called her back.
18600	Let's hope they're making an order.
21444	<strong>Anna<br></strong>â€¦laser technology isn't cheapâ€¦ hmm, I seeâ€¦ Well, thanks for calling back. Bye.
30865	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Everything OK Anna?
32671	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Not really. One of the companies I cold called has rung backâ€¦
37703	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Good, goodâ€¦
38806	<strong>Anna<br></strong>â€¦but they don't want to place an order. They say we're too expensive.
43959	<strong>Paul<br></strong>So you let them go? Didn't you negotiate with them?
49257	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, was I meant to? I wasn't sure what to say.
54851	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Having trouble Anna? Don't worry, I'm sure that I can help.
59286	Negotiating is my thing!
61674	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>"Negotiating is my thing"! What is he like?
65605	Mind you, he has won a Pear Salesman of the Year award so he must be doing something right.
71972	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Are you sure Tom? Don't you want to negotiate your own deals?
77890	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I owe you one Anna after you saved my bacon with Mr Socrates the other night.
83307	And besides you and meâ€¦
85792	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Come on you two. Get a move on.
87821	Europe is waiting for us! Custard cream anyone?
92150	<strong>Tom<br></strong>No thanks. Right.
93942	Now you need to call that French company back and ask them what kind of price they are willing to pay.
100430	<strong>Anna<br></strong>And then say that's fine?
102826	<strong>Tom<br></strong>No! Negotiate. Say "I don't think we can go that low".
109072	<strong>Anna<br></strong>"I don't think we can go that low".
113823	<strong>Tom<br></strong>If they want a bigger discount, tell them they will have to buy more stock.
120210	<strong>Anna<br></strong>More stock, bigger discount.
122578	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah. And if you still can't agree a price, tell them "I'll meet you halfway".
129607	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Meet halfway?! That means going to Paris!
134350	<strong>Tom<br></strong>No. Halfway on the price.
136870	That line always works for me. I sold a load of plastic pears that way once.
143162	<strong>Anna<br></strong>So that's "I'll meet you halfway".
146999	Thanks Tom. I'm really impressed. Youâ€¦ youâ€¦
152300	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Am I, really?!
153980	<strong>Anna<br></strong>What? I was going to say, you really do know your stuff â€“ despite what other people say.
160519	<strong>Tom<br></strong>What? Uh?
161700	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right, I'm off to make that call right now.
167099	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Good luck Anna and well done Tom!
170050	Nice to hear him give some useful advice but will it work?
174675	Let's remind ourselves of the phrases he suggested Anna uses when negotiating a sale:<br>What kind of price are you willing to pay?
183172	I don't think we can go that low.
187049	If you buy more stock, I can offer you a bigger discount.
193046	I'll meet you halfway.
196042	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Let's see how Anna has got on.
203475	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Success! They've agreed to buy 5,000 Imperial Lemons.
208345	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Brilliant. I knew you would be great.
212062	Did those killer lines of mine work?
215145	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Sort of â€“ but when I said what price were they looking to pay, they said the full price!
221797	As long as I send them the contract today so I'd better go and get an envelope and post it as soon as I can.
228690	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh great.
232181	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tomâ€¦ Tomâ€¦ can you come over here to the stationery cupboard and get an envelope from the top shelf for me?
239917	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, suppose soâ€¦ I'm coming. (Door slams shut) â€¦oh!
246068	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh Tom, why did you do that?
249840	It won't openâ€¦ it's lockedâ€¦ help, help!
255228	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Help!
256603	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Uh oh. This should be interesting.
259463	How are they going to explain being locked in the stationery cupboard?
264035	Until next time.Bye!
266653	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Let us out! We're stuck!
