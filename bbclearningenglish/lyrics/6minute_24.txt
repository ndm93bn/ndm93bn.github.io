1	( Introduction... )
12343	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.
15608	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>...And I'm Rob.
16746	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So, it's nearly exam time again.
19402	And the subject of today's show is how to prepare well for an exam.
23990	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I've got some great tips, actually, Alice.
26194	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Have you really?
27136	Can you remind me what grades you got at school?
30158	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, well ... [mumbles] ...
32717	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So, you didn't get very good grades.
36503	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I probably should've started revising earlier.
39546	But my learning strategies were very good.
41852	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh, really? Well, when you <strong>revise</strong> for an exam you study information you learned before.
48165	OK, Rob, I'd love to hear more about your learning strategies, but first here's today's quiz question for you.
54888	What's the word for a system, such as use of special poems or rhymes to help you remember something?
62350	Is it ...<br>a) pneumatics<br>b) mnemonics<br>Or c) hypnotics?
69242	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I'll go for b) mnemonics.
72166	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later on in the show.
76204	Now, according to current scientific research, some study methods popular with students aren't actually very effective.
84223	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Don't tell me - putting your textbook under your pillow at night doesn't work.
88422	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Did you try doing that, Rob?
90493	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, I did, but without much success.
93057	Maybe I was using the wrong kind of pillow?!
95446	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, let's talk about more conventional methods than the book-under-the-pillow one.
100381	These include summarising, highlighting or underlining text to help you remember it.
106673	I do love a pack of highlighting pens, though.
109484	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh yes, me too.
110522	And actually highlighting text was one of my top tips.
114483	But I used to get so absorbed with the highlighting I'm not sure I was actually learning anything useful.
120043	My notebooks were works of art, though!
122230	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, and that's the point made by John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US, who says that you need to do more than just highlight information.
134197	You need to test yourself on it.
136192	Let's hear from him now.
137831	<strong>INSERT<br> John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US<br></strong>Students who can basically test themselves or try to retrieve material from their memory are going to learn that material in the long run a lot better.
147797	So for instance maybe you start by reading a textbook using your favourite highlighter and favourite colours, but then you go back and make flashcards of all the critical concepts and instead of just rereading those, you basically try to test yourselves on them.
161363	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Professor John Dunlosky there.
164723	So he says trying to memorise the material isn't enough.
169180	You need to do something with it, for example, making flashcards of <strong>critical</strong> - or important - concepts and then testing yourself on them.
177307	<strong><br><br></strong><strong>Alice<br></strong>By repeatedly testing yourself on something, you strengthen the pathways between <strong>neurons</strong> - or nerve cells - in the brain.
184597	And the more often you do this, the easier it becomes to retrieve information.
189394	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And <strong>retrieve</strong> means to get something back.
192271	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's right.
193286	When you repeatedly test yourself over a longer period of time - for example, over months or weeks - this is called <strong>distributed practice</strong> - and psychologists believe this is a very effective way to learn.
205855	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It sounds like hard work, though, doesn't it?
208220	I prefer the <strong>cramming</strong> method - which means to try and learn lots of information in a short period of time.
214981	For example, the night before the exam.
217537	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I don't know, Rob.
219062	We don't cram to learn other things - like music or dancing, or football or language learning.
225679	It's far more effective to join a conversation class and practise speaking every week than to practise for hours in front of the mirror the night before your oral exam!
234906	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's a good point.
236366	In fact, I used to sing irregular French verbs to myself, every day in the shower for weeks before my French exam, and that helped me remember them more easily.
246365	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Excellent!
247437	Making different types of associations with what you're trying to learn - for example, musical associations - is meant to be effective.
254758	Let's listen now to Professor Dunlovsky talking about visual associations.
259521	<strong>INSERT<br> John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US<br></strong>I would encourage students as they are reading to try and elaborate mentally using images, as they're reading, to kind of develop a more vivid picture of what they're reading.
268499	Again, that'll help quite a bit for some kinds of studies - maybe history and so forth - and a little bit less so for more conceptual studies.
274795	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And if you <strong>elaborate</strong> on something, it means you add more information - in this case, mental pictures.
282537	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So, creating mental pictures is useful for some subjects - like history or languages.
288646	But <strong>conceptual</strong> subjects - ones based on abstract ideas rather than things - like maths, for example - it might not be so easy to associate ideas with pictures.
299276	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now what about Albert Einstein?
301609	People say he was a very visual thinker.
304089	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, you've got me there, Rob.
305817	I don't know the answer to that but I can give you the answer to today's quiz question.
310715	I asked: What's the word for a system, such as use of special poems or rhymes to help you remember something?
318110	Is it ... <br>a) pneumatics, b) mnemonics or c) hypnotics?
324515	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I said mnemonics.
326199	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And you were right!
328888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Great!
329518	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well done!
330281	Research on mnemonics suggests they are a good strategy for learning certain kinds of things, like how to spell difficult words.
337801	For example, the first letters of this sentence: '<strong>b</strong>ig <strong>e</strong>lephants <strong>c</strong>ause <strong>a</strong>ccidents <strong>u</strong>nder <strong>s</strong>mall <strong>e</strong>lephants' spells 'because'.
347938	Now, do you think you can remember the words we heard today, Rob?
351679	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We heard:<br>revise<br>critical<br>neurons<br>retrieve<br>distributed practice<br>cramming<br>elaborate<br>conceptual
364560	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
367251	Remember to join us again soon!
369177	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye.
