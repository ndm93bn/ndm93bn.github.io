11055	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
15055	<strong>Rob <br></strong>And me, Rob. Hello.
16350	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Today's programme is all about describing things.
20282	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's right. We're going to explain how to use the words <strong>too</strong> and <strong>very</strong> with adjectives to describe things.
27477	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We are, and we'll show you how to use the word <strong>enough</strong> with adjectives and nouns.
32113	<strong>Rob<br></strong>...we'll explain the difference between <strong>too much</strong> and <strong>too many</strong>â€¦
35754	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we'll finish with a quiz â€“ so listen carefully.
41504	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And to help us with all our example sentences today we're bringing you this episode of 6 Minute Grammar from a clothes shop.
49023	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, we're clothes shopping!
51055	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We are, well, Catherine's clothes shopping.
53416	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>I'm going to a party. Rob, look, this blue dress - I love it - do you?
57799	<strong>Rob <br></strong>It's not really my colour.
60548	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You're not going to wear it Rob.
63212	Actually...it's too big. Oooh â€“ this one's nice â€“ what do you think Rob?
69105	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's a bit short isn't it.
71465	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Mmmm. It's too small.
73233	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Too big...too small.
75632	Catherine used the word <strong>too</strong> here with the adjectives <strong>big</strong> and <strong>small </strong>to say that that the dress is not right â€“ it's bigger or smaller than she wants or needs.
86094	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right! Rob! Found one - red one, look.
88710	What do you think?
89503	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I do like the colour. It suits you.
91932	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is lovely but...it's very expensive!
96065	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, [whistles] Â£150. I see what you mean.
102172	So, we use <strong>very</strong> with an adjective to make it stronger.
106751	The red dress is not just <strong>expensive</strong> â€“ it's <strong>very expensive</strong>.
110554	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Very, very expensive. But look!
112564	Green one, look at this green one, it's cheaper â€“ and it looks big enough.
116964	What do you think, Rob?
118806	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It does suit you and it's cheaper.
123079	Let's take it before you change your mind. Do you have enough money?
126553	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Do I have enough money?!
127565	Are you serious? Yes, of course.
129356	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Let's see your purse then.
132612	So, the word <strong>enough</strong> with an adjective describes the right amount of something.
138098	So, the green dress is <strong>big enough</strong> - and <strong>long enough</strong>.
141413	We've found it! We've got the dress! Hooray!
144025	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Er Rob. Actually, I don't have <strong>enough cash</strong> on me.
148595	and I've left my credit card in the office. I don't suppose...would you mind.?
152764	<strong>Rob<br></strong>What are you saying.? Okay okay. How much is it?
158267	so we can also use <strong>enough</strong> before a noun to say that we have the right amount of something: so we can ask: Do you have <strong>enough money</strong>?
167568	and we can also use <strong>enough</strong> in the negative to say we have less of something than we need.
172450	Catherine doesn't have enough cash.
174418	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you Rob. You're very generous.
176844	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, time for a recap. We use <strong>too</strong> before an adjective:
181633	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The blue dress is <strong>too small</strong>.
184070	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Very</strong> goes before an adjective.
186374	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The red dress is <strong>very expensive</strong>.
188991	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Enough </strong>goes after an adjective.
191461	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>This dress is <strong>big enough</strong>.
193009	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And<strong> enough</strong> goes before a noun.
195399	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I don't have <strong>enough</strong> <strong>money</strong>.
196836	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Let's go. I've done enough shopping for today.
199783	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, come on.
200693	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Grammar, from BBC Learning English.
206721	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Phew. We're back in the studio. It's just like magic isn't it!
210647	And Catherine, you got the dress so, how was the party?
214519	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, it was great except.
217137	I ate <strong>too much food</strong>...and.
219401	<strong>Rob<br></strong>...yes?
219905	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...there were <strong>too many people</strong> wearing my dress!
228120	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh, that's a pity.
230120	So this is <strong>too</strong> with <strong>much</strong> and <strong>many</strong> to talk about an amount or number of something that's more or less than we want or need.
238868	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, I ate more food than I needed.
242061	<strong>Rob<br></strong>...and it's a pity there were too many green dresses.
245255	So, for plural countable nouns like <strong>dresses</strong>, we use <strong>too many</strong> - <strong>too many dresses, too many people.
253362	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and for uncountable nouns like <strong>food</strong> and <strong>money</strong>, we use <strong>too much.
259291	<strong>Rob<br></strong>...and Catherine ate <strong>too much food</strong>.
262043	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...and the red dress cost <strong>too much money</strong>.
264702	<strong>Rob <br></strong>It did, luckily.
265649	Now, be careful not to use <strong>very</strong> with strong adjectives.
270617	You cannot say the party was very fantastic.
274008	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Instead, say: the party was <strong>absolutely</strong> fantastic!
279652	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But not for you! And now, it's time for a quiz!
286275	Fill the gaps. Number one. I can't hear you - there's too [beep] noise.
293380	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: I can't hear you â€“ there's too <strong>much</strong> noise.
297727	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Good. Number two. Hiro is only 13.
301452	He's not old [beep] to drive yet.
304220	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hiro is only 13.
306754	He's not old <strong>enough</strong> to drive yet.
309614	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And Number three. Those shoes don't fit me. They are [beep] small.
315783	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Those shoes don't fit me. They are <strong>too</strong> small.
319764	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, no more parties, then?
321605	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>...Well actually Rob, there's one coming up this weekend and.
324628	I saw a lovely pair of blue shoes, they're not too expensive.
330832	<strong>Rob<br></strong>You've got time to go and get your credit card for this one - I'm not paying!
