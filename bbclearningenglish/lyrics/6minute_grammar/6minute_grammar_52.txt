1	(Introduction...)
10900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
14600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And me, Neil.
16600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Neil, have a sandwich. It's from Finn. He said you were hungry.
20900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Really?
21600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes! He said. In fact, Finn said: "He's hungry. Give him a sandwich."
26666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Wow! That's very kind of Finn. It's delicious.
30600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And in today's programme we're talking about reported speech.
34500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We'll be discussing why and when we use it. And we'll see how to form it.
42200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We use reported speech when we want to report something that another person said. In our example, Finn originally said:
51200	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>He's hungry.
52506	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's direct speech. Catherine reported the direct speech, like this:
58100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Finn said you were hungry.
60500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Let's look at that more closely. We need to make some grammatical changes when we report what someone else says.
68700	First, when the speaker or listener changes, we need to change the pronouns.
74200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. Finn used <strong>he</strong> in direct speech to talk about Neil:
80500	<strong>Finn</strong><br><strong>He</strong> is hungry.
83500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Then Catherine told me what Finn said.
87131	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Finn said <strong>you</strong> were hungry.
90389	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Second change: In reported speech we often move the tense back one step into the past.
98100	So <strong>is hungry</strong> becomes <strong>were hungry</strong>.
101592	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But we don't have to change the verb tense in reported speech if the situation is generally true.
109200	Here's an example. Finn, give us a sentence please:
112370	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK. I <strong>love</strong> cheese sandwiches.
116600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you, Finn. And Neil, can you report what Finn said, please?
120800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. Finn said he <strong>loves</strong> cheese sandwiches.
124102	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. So there we don't change <strong>loves</strong> to <strong>loved</strong>, because Finn loves cheese sandwiches and that's a general truth.
132191	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now the third thing we need with reported speech is a reporting verb.
137176	<strong>Say</strong> and <strong>tell</strong> are the most common ones.
140819	And we usually put them in the past tense. For example: Finn <strong>said</strong> Neil was hungry.
147800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now let's look at how to report questions with question words like <strong>What</strong> and <strong>Who</strong>.
153567	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We'll hear the direct speech first from Finn, then Catherine will give us the reported speech.
159323	<strong>Finn<br></strong>What's the time?
162000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Finn asked what the time was.
165100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The reporting verb comes first, then the question word, and then the reported sentence with the tense moved back.
172741	And don't forget to change the word order from question word order to statement word order. Another one please Finn and Catherine?
180444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Who ate the cake?
182925	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>He asked who'd eaten the cake.
186800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, now it's time to look at pronunciation.
190691	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, pronuciation. Some past tense forms in reported speech can be difficult to hear.
197022	In the last example, the two words <strong>who</strong> and <strong>had</strong> become who'd. He asked who'd eaten the cake.
207888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So <strong>had</strong> is shortened to just a <strong>/d/</strong> sound.
212200	Listen out for the short <strong>/d/</strong> sound in this next example:
217200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>She asked where I'd gone.
220596	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, the phrase <strong>I had</strong> becomes <strong>I'd</strong>. One more time please Finn:
227275	<strong>Finn<br></strong>She asked where I'd gone.
229957	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you, Finn. So watch out for contractions in reported speech.
240000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And now are you ready?
242500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>For a quiz?
243476	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's quiz time! Finn is going to say some sentences in direct speech.
252082	As you listen, decide what the correct reported speech is. Here's the first one.
258000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I've eaten my lunch.
261782	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Is the reported speech a) He said he's eating his lunch or b) He said he'd eaten his lunch?
272222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is b) He said he'd eaten his lunch.
278156	The present perfect changes to the past perfect.
281333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK. Next one please Finn:
283009	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I go to work by bus.
286587	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Is the reported speech a) Finn said he goes to work by bus or b) Finn said he's going to work by bus?
298444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's a) Finn said he goes to work by bus.
303152	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK. And here's the last one:
305188	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Where are my glasses?
307556	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Is it a) He asked where were his glasses or b) He asked where his glasses were?
316000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the right answer is b) He asked where his glasses were.
321480	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, before we go, thereâ€™s just enough time for a top tip.
325227	With the reporting verb <strong>tell</strong> we say who the person is talking to, for example, Finn <strong>told me</strong> he's going to pay for lunch today.
334700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Wow! And when we use the reporting verb <strong>say</strong> we don't say who the person is talking to. So this next sentence is wrong:
344400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Finn <strong>said me</strong> he was going to pay for lunch today.
348500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, that's wrong but this one is correct:
350897	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Finn <strong>said </strong>he was going to pay for lunch today.
354222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that's reported speech.
356114	<strong>Neil</strong><br>There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
360685	Join us again for 6 Minute Grammar.
362915	<strong>Neil and Catherine<br></strong>Bye.
