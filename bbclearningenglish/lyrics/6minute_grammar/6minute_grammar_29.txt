1	(Introduction...)
9900	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.
13277	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And me, Catherine.
14300	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>Todayâ€™s programme is about a couple of ways of talking about the future.
18817	The <strong>future continuous</strong> verb form and <strong>be</strong> plus the infinitive.
23500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So <strong>youâ€™re to listen</strong> carefullyâ€¦
25588	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>Good example!
26222	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Thank you. Letâ€™s start with the future continuous.
32466	Hereâ€™s an example. This time next week, Iâ€™ll be sitting on a beach in Mallorca.
38000	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Lucky you! So, <strong>Iâ€™ll be sitting</strong>, in the future continuous, is an event that will be happening at a particular time in the future.
46777	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And Iâ€™ve already planned it. I used the time phrase <strong>this time next week</strong>.
52165	We can use other time phrases like â€¦<strong>next year</strong>.
55414	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Or <strong>tonight</strong>, for example. We can also use the future continuous to say how long weâ€™ll be doing something.
63111	So Catherine how long will you be staying in Mallorca?
66777	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Iâ€™ll be staying in Palma <strong>for one week </strong>before travelling around the island.
71100	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>So Catherine used the future continuous to say she plans to stay in Palma for <strong>a week.
75666	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Thatâ€™s right. Now we can also use the future continuous to say weâ€™ll be doing something while something else is happeningâ€¦ So, Callum, <strong>while youâ€™re working </strong>at the BBC <strong>Iâ€™ll be</strong> <strong>sipping</strong> my cocktails by the hotel pool!
90456	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes, notice that we usually use the present continuous in the time phrase after <strong>while</strong>â€¦ Catherine said <strong>while Iâ€™m working.
100113	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>We could use <strong>when </strong>instead of while, and follow it with the present simple. Hereâ€™s an example.
105403	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>A taxi will be waiting when you arrive.
108200	<strong>STING</strong>
113200	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Today weâ€™re looking at the future continuous to talk about future plans.
118222	<strong>Callum<br></strong>But we use it for other things as well. For example, we can use the future continuous to make predictions. Hereâ€™s an example.
125222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Those clouds look very dark. Itâ€™ll be raining soon.
129138	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Rob knows itâ€™ll be raining soon because the sky is very dark.
133400	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>We can also use the future continuous to say what we imagine to be true at the moment. Listen to this example.
140400	<strong>Rob <br></strong>You canâ€™t ring Abdul now! Itâ€™s two oâ€™clock in the morning in Dubai. <strong>Heâ€™ll be sleeping</strong>.
145935	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We donâ€™t know for certain that Abdul is sleeping, but itâ€™s likely.
150333	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Sometimes we use the future continuous in a question when we want to be polite. Hereâ€™s an example
155798	<strong>Rob<br> Will you be staying </strong>for dinner?
157888	<strong>STING</strong>
164333	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>We form the future continuous with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or<strong> wonâ€™t </strong>plus <strong>be </strong>and the <strong>â€“ing form</strong> of the main verb. Here are some examples :
174147	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Iâ€™ll be sitting by the pool. <br>I wonâ€™t be taking any work with me. <br>Theyâ€™ll be arriving after midnight.
182209	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Notice that we usually use contracted forms, so I<strong>â€™ll</strong> â€¦and <strong>wonâ€™t</strong>.
188900	<strong>Callum<br></strong>For questions itâ€™s <strong>will</strong> or <strong>wonâ€™t</strong> plus <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>be</strong> plus the <strong>â€“ing</strong> form of the verb.
196349	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Why will they be arriving so late tonight?
199000	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>So thatâ€™s the future continuous. Now letâ€™s look at <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>the infinitive</strong>.
204100	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>We sometimes use this to tell someone what they must or mustnâ€™t do. Here are some examples.
209800	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Students are to enter the hall from the back. <br>Youâ€™re not to go out without telling me!
215300	<strong>Callum<br></strong>We often find this structure in more formal English, for example to describe official arrangements.
221400	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are to visit Singapore next month.
225688	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Or in media reports to say what will almost certainly happen.
229700	We form this structure with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>be </strong>plus the<strong> infinitive with to. </strong>Listen to this example.
237109	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>A man is to appear in court later today charged with murder.
241111	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>For the negative itâ€™s <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>not</strong> plus the <strong>infinitive with to</strong>.
246921	<strong>Rob<br></strong>You are not to go to bed late tonight!
249288	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And remember, we often use short forms like: <strong>Youâ€™re not </strong>and <strong>He isnâ€™tâ€¦</strong>
254777	<strong>IDENT</strong>
261799	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We're talking about the <strong>future continuous</strong> tense and <strong>be plus the infinitive</strong>.
266333	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>So, to recap, we use the future continuous to describe plans at a particular time in the future or for how long weâ€™ll be doing something.
275000	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>We also use it for predictionsâ€¦
277222	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>And for polite enquiries and to say what we assume is happening.
282000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We use <strong>be </strong>plus<strong> the infinitive </strong>for future events which involve instruction or necessity.
288725	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And for official arrangements or reports saying what will almost certainly happen.
299734	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Time for our quiz. Which is correct a or b. Ready?
306800	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Number one. <br>a) I work in New York next summer or <br>b) Iâ€™ll be working in New York next summer.
317837	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> Itâ€™s b).
319203	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Correct. Number 2. <br>a) Students are not to bring their cars to school. <br>b) Students are not bring their cars to school.

347222	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> Itâ€™s b.
348333	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Correct and thatâ€™s the end of the programme.
