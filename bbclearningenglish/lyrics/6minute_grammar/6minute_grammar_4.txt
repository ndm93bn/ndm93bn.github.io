1	(Introduction...)
12719	<strong>Finn <br> </strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
16532	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>And me, Alice. Hello.
18457	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Today we're talking about <strong>defining relative clauses</strong>.
22943	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>That's right: defining relative clauses. We'll explain what they are.
27616	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>We'll look at how they work.
29591	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>We'll hear lots of examples.
31488	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And we'll have a quiz to practice what we've learned. So: on with the show.
37469	Let's start by looking at what relative clauses are, and how we make them.
43001	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Yes. Defining relative clauses give information about a noun in a sentence or question.
49517	They define - or, give more information about - the thing that we are talking about.
55793	Here's Catherine with our first example:
59150	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Have you seen the shoes that I bought today?
62400	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>The defining relative clause is the phrase <strong>that I bought today</strong> - and it tells us <strong>which</strong> shoes Catherine is talking about.
72544	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>That's right. Catherine probably has several pairs of shoes: adding the phrase <strong>that I bought today</strong> tells us exactly which shoes she means.
82738	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So: let's have a closer look at the grammar of relative clauses.
87978	We start with a noun and then we add a relative pronoun, such as <strong>who</strong> or <strong>that</strong>, plus a verb phrase.
97407	The relative pronoun <strong>who</strong> is for <strong>people</strong>. Catherine.
101577	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>The man <strong>who</strong> owns this restaurant is my best friend.
105419	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>So the defining relative clause <strong>who owns this restaurant</strong> tells us exactly which man is Catherine's best friend.
113931	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>The pronoun <strong>which </strong>is for things, and we use <strong>that</strong> for both people and things.
121732	Here's an example with <strong>which</strong>.
124236	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Spring is the season <strong>which</strong> I enjoy the most.
127820	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Ahh - me too! So, to give more information about a thing - the season - we add the relative pronoun - <strong>which</strong>, plus the verb phrase <strong>I enjoy the most</strong><em>.
140783	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Here's another example.
142270	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>That woman is the doctor <strong>who</strong> saw me yesterday.
146041	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>This time, the pronoun <strong>who</strong> refers to the doctor.
151524	And the doctor is the subject of the verb saw - the doctor saw Catherine.
158872	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Right.
159815	<strong>Who</strong> refers to the <strong>subject</strong> of the verb: The doctor who saw me yesterday.
165525	Now this next example is slightly different: listen carefully.
170086	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>That woman is the doctor <strong>who</strong> <strong>I saw</strong> yesterday.
175192	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Again, <strong>who</strong> refers to the doctor.
178828	But this time, the doctor is the <strong>object</strong> of the verb <strong>saw</strong> - Catherine saw the doctor.
185597	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So the rule is: when the pronoun refers to the <strong>subject</strong>, it's:
191950	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>She's the doctor <strong>who saw me</strong> yesterday.
194926	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>And when the pronoun refers to the <strong>object</strong>, it's:
199022	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>She's the doctor <strong>who I saw</strong> yesterday.
202630	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Now some people like to use <strong>whom</strong> instead of <strong>who</strong> in object relative clauses:
209256	<strong>Catherine <br> </strong>...the doctor <strong>whom I saw</strong>.
211518	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>And that's fine. <strong>Whom</strong> is correct here.
215622	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Although <strong>who</strong> is probably more common in spoken English these days.
221641	<strong>IDENT <br> </strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
228087	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>And we're talking about defining relative clauses.
231465	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And now it's quiz time. They're all about Harry Potter, these questions.
236715	So if you like the film it may be easier for you.
239667	I'll say some key words and you have to make them into a sentence with a defining relative clause.
247291	Here's the first one.
249108	<strong>Robbie Coltrane - actor - play - Hagrid.
259681	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Robbie Coltrane is the actor <strong>who</strong> played Hagrid...in Harry Potter.
267587	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And another one: <strong>Hogwarts - school - Harry Potter - go.
280007	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Hogwarts is the school <strong>that</strong> Harry Potter went to.
284621	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Very good. Last one: <strong>Hermione - marry - Ron Weasley.
292146	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Ooh. Hermione is the girl <strong>who</strong> married Ron Weasley.
299652	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Or as an object clause it's:
303370	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Hermione is the girl <strong>who</strong> Ron Weasley married.
306447	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Well done if you got those right.
308555	Now before we finish, there's just time to mention that, in everyday English, it's fine to leave out the pronoun completely when the relative pronoun is the <strong>object </strong>of the relative clause.
322815	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>For example: <strong>Hermione is the girl who Ron Weasley married</strong> becomes:
328547	<strong>Finn<br> </strong><strong>Hermione is the girl Ron Weasley married</strong><em>.
332252	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Ahhh. Don't you think she should have married Harry?
335168	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Well, I really think its Hermione's choice, Alice.
338190	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Fair enough.
339137	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So, that's the end of our brief look at defining relative clauses.
343412	They begin with a pronoun and go after the noun that you want to define.
348599	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>Yes. There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
