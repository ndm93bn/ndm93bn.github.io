11201	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil.
14777	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>And me, Finn.
15957	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>Todayâ€™s programme is all about the future perfect continuous tense.
20722	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Weâ€™ll tell you when to use itâ€¦
22666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>How to form itâ€¦
23611	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And how it differs from the future perfect tense.
26800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Letâ€™s start with an example of the future perfect:
30843	<strong>Rob<br></strong>This time next year, Iâ€™ll have finished my course.
34222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Here, the action - finishing the course - will be completed before a particular time in the future â€“ this time next year.
42999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK. And now for the future perfect continuous:
47444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>In January, Iâ€™ll have been studying for three years.
51529	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Here, the action â€“ studying - goes right up to the specified time and will probably continue afterwards.
59888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, we use the future perfect continuous rather than the future perfect when we want to focus on the continuous nature of the activity and how long it will be going on for.
72111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We often use the future perfect continuous with <strong>for </strong>plus an amount of time.
77333	So, in the earlier example, we had <strong>for three years</strong>.
81319	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Letâ€™s have some more examples of the future perfect continuous:
85434	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Tomorrow <strong>Iâ€™ll have been working </strong>here for six months.
89444	In July <strong>weâ€™ll have been living</strong> in Dubai for two years.
94888	By the time the bus gets here, <strong>weâ€™ll have been waiting</strong> over an hour.
100400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Notice that the last example didnâ€™t have <strong>for</strong>, as we donâ€™t always have to include it.
106068	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, we usually use a time phrase with both tenses to state the particular time in the future.
112845	These often start with <strong>by</strong> or <strong>in</strong>. Listen to these examples:
118310	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>By 2020</strong> the cityâ€™s population will have doubled.
122999	<strong>In June</strong> Iâ€™ll have been unemployed for five months.
127200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You can use <strong>by </strong>or <strong>in</strong>â€¦ with any future day, date, month, season or special day.
135444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>For the future perfect continuous, the time phrases sometimes begin with <strong>in </strong>or <strong>on</strong>:
141777	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>On Sunday</strong>, heâ€™ll have been travelling for three weeks.
145822	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We often use <strong>when</strong> or <strong>by the time </strong>in time phrases with both tenses. Listen to these examples:
154305	<strong>Rob <br>When your train gets in</strong>, weâ€™ll have been waiting for over two hours.
159666	<strong>By the time you get</strong> home, the chicken will have been cooking for two hours.
164888	<strong>By the time you get back</strong>, weâ€™ll have had dinner.
168555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Notice that <strong>when </strong>and<strong> by the time </strong>are followed by a verb.
173888	This verb is in the present simple, not the future.
177222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, as well as predicting future events and situations, we can also use the future perfect and future perfect continuous to say what we imagine might or might not have happened:
189724	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They <strong>wonâ€™t have arrived</strong> yet. They only left twenty minutes ago.
194700	Sam didnâ€™t come home last night.<strong> Heâ€™ll have been working </strong>all night to finish his report.
200659	<strong>Neil<br></strong>In the first example, we assume that they havenâ€™t arrived yet, based on the knowledge that they only left 20 minutes ago.
208666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And in the second example, we imagine that Sam has been working all night because he didnâ€™t come home last night.
217973	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We form the future perfect with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or<strong> wonâ€™t </strong>plus <strong>have </strong>and the <strong>past participle </strong>of the main verb.
226333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>By the summer <strong>Iâ€™ll have finished</strong> all my exams.
230555	The film <strong>wonâ€™t have started</strong> yet.
233264	<strong>Finn<br></strong>For the future perfect continuous, itâ€™s <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or <strong>wonâ€™t</strong> plus <strong>have</strong> plus <strong>been</strong> plus the <strong>present participle</strong>.
243666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They <strong>wonâ€™t have been watching</strong> the match as they are on holiday.
246888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>For future perfect questions, itâ€™s <strong>will</strong> or <strong>wonâ€™t</strong> plus <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>have</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>.
253614	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Will you have managed </strong>to read all the reports by this afternoon?
257444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Asking questions in the future perfect continuous is more usually done with question tags, so the order is the same as for statements.
266100	<strong>Rob<br></strong>He <strong>wonâ€™t have been working</strong> all day, will he?
269000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Question words can also be used in which case itâ€™s <strong>will</strong> plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>have</strong> plus <strong>been</strong> plus <strong>present participle</strong>.
277900	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>What will they have been talking</strong> about?
280520	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English
285666	<strong>Finn <br></strong>We're talking about the future perfect continuous tense.
289444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>To recap, we use the future perfect continuous to talk about something that will be going on at a particular time in the futureâ€¦
296900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Or to say what we assume has or hasnâ€™t already happened.
301700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now it's time for our quiz. Which is correct a or b. Are you ready?
