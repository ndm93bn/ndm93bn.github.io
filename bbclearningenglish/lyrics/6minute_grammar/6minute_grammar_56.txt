11858	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar. I'm Finnâ€¦
15500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs.
24440	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, we'll explain what they are and how you use them.
28200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We'll have lots of examples and of course we'll finish with a quiz.
35900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But first, let's listen to Mary. She's a lifestyle coach and she has some advice for us about friends and friendship.
44484	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And listen out for the answer to this question: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?
51812	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Mary<br></strong>How often do you and your friends <strong>get together</strong>?
54848	In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let our </strong>friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>.
62222	Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by </strong>us when we need support.
66070	So while it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media, psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.
79222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So that was Mary. And we asked: What do psychologists say that it is important to do?
85600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: They say it's important for us and our friends to <strong>meet up</strong>.
90850	And I think they mean face to face. What do you think, Finn?
93600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>They do. Face-to-face meeting up is the best thing, they say.
97300	And there's our first phrasal verb - <strong>meet up</strong>.
101222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, meet up. Now, a phrasal verb is a two-word verb made of a verb plus a little word like <strong>in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, or<strong> up</strong>.
111300	We usually think of<strong> in</strong>,<strong> on</strong>,<strong> out</strong>, and<strong> up</strong> as prepositions, but in phrasal verbs they behave more like adverbs.
120700	<strong>Finn</strong><br>They do. In the phrasal verb <strong>meet up</strong>, the adverb <strong>up</strong> modifies the meaning of the verb <strong>meet</strong>.
129200	<strong>Meet</strong> and <strong>meet up</strong> are very similar in meaning.
131900	But the adverb sometimes does more than that. Listen to this clip.
138222	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Mary<br></strong>...psychologists <strong>point out</strong> that it's really important to make time to <strong>meet up</strong> together too.
144700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right, we heard the phrasal verb <strong>point out</strong> there, but it doesn't mean the same as the verb <strong>point</strong>.
152114	<strong>Point out</strong> means to say something interesting, or unusual or useful.
157700	And the adverb changes the meaning significantly.
160900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It does. Now listen out for more phrasal verbs in this clip.
166182	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Mary <br></strong>In our busy lives today, it's easy to <strong>let </strong>our friends <strong>down</strong> by <strong>putting off</strong> social arrangements or even forgetting to <strong>ring</strong> them <strong>up</strong>.
175000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now if we <strong>let</strong> our friends <strong>down</strong>, it means that we don't help or support them.
181000	And when we <strong>put off</strong> arrangements, we cancel or delay them.
185400	And if we <strong>ring</strong> people <strong>up</strong>, we phone them.
188155	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And those are interesting phrasal verbs because when they have an object, we can put the object either between the verb and the adverb, or we can put it after the adverb.
200905	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Like this: we can <strong>let our friends down</strong> or we can <strong>let down our friends</strong>.
207833	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You wouldn't let your friends down.
208800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I'd never let my friends down, Catherine. Or my colleagues.
213000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we can <strong>put off arrangements</strong> or <strong>put arrangements off</strong>.
217500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We can. But be careful.
219569	If the object is a pronoun, you have to put it in the middle.
223837	For example, you have to say <strong>ring them up</strong>.
227555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah. Don't say <strong>ring up them</strong>.
230000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No, don't say that. Now, one more clip.
233333	Can you spot any more phrasal verbs?
236725	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Mary<br></strong>Yet our friends are the people who <strong>stand by us</strong> when we need support.
242000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, we just heard<strong> stand by us.
245600	</strong> And you are probably wondering why the pronoun is at the end of the verb because we just said that you can't put pronouns at the end.
253839	But <strong>stand by</strong> is a slightly different type of verb, because <strong>by</strong> isn't an adverb. It's a preposition.
262700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. In some two-word verbs, the second word such as <strong>by</strong>,<strong> with</strong>,<strong> into</strong>, or<strong> on </strong>behaves like a preposition, not an adverb.
274400	And in these verbs, the object or object pronoun always comes after the preposition.
281111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. So Mary said that it's great to <strong>keep up with</strong> people on social media.
287100	And <strong>keep up with</strong> means <strong>keep in contact with</strong>, and it's a phrasal verb made of three parts: a verb: <strong>keep</strong>, plus an adverb: <strong>up</strong>, plus a preposition: <strong>with</strong>.
298900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. And with phrasal verbs with three parts, the object always comes at the end.
305400	We <strong>keep up with people</strong>.
307535	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.
313662	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's time for a quiz!
317800	Number one. Is this sentence correct or wrong?
321500	She took her coat off, hung it up and sat down.
325888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's correct. Number two: correct or wrong?
330068	We keep with each other up by phone and email.
334649	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that one is wrong.
336915	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...sounds horrible! The correct sentence is: We keep up with each other by phone and email.
341800	So, number three: I turned down the job because it was too far away.
346700	Now the question is: can you also say a) I turned down it. Or b) I turned it down?
354751	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Well, this time you can say b) I turned it down.
358699	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You can. And very good if you got those right at home.
361744	<strong>Finn<br></strong>There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.

368627	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!
