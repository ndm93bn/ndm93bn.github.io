1	(Introduction...)
11484	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
15915	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And me, Sophie. Hello.
17972	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In todayâ€™s programme weâ€™re talking about the past simple tenseâ€¦
22038	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦ when we use it, how we form it for regular verbsâ€¦
25333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦weâ€™ll take a look at some irregular verbs, negative sentences and questions.
31911	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦and weâ€™ll finish as usual with a quiz.
34002	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ok - so letâ€™s get started!
35770	The past simple is a tense in English that we use to talk about an event that happened and finished in the past.
44325	Hereâ€™s Neil with our first example:
47375	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Jack Dorsey invented Twitter in 2006.
52591	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Thanks Neil. Now, we often find the past simple in stories like this:
58079	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The boy started running. Suddenly, he stopped and listenedâ€¦
63003	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Wow - sounds like an exciting story!
65843	And it had three past simple verbs: <em>started, stopped, </em>and<em> listened</em>.
73348	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦ and they are all regular verbs.
75424	We make the past simple of regular verbs by adding an â€˜eâ€™ and a â€˜dâ€™ to the infinitive.
81112	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ so the past simple of <em>start</em> is <em>started,</em>
85210	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦ the past simple of <em>stop </em>is <em>stopped,</em>
87842	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ and the past simple of <em>listen</em> is <em>listened</em>
91677	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦ did you spot the difference in the pronunciation there?
94574	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, sometimes the â€˜eâ€™ and â€˜dâ€™ at the end sounds like a â€˜tâ€™.
100213	â€˜tâ€™. Listen: Stopped. Stopped.
104860	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Sometimes it sounds more like â€˜idâ€™.
108222	â€˜idâ€™. Started. Started.
112986	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ or like a â€˜dâ€™: Listened. Listened.
118674	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Letâ€™s hear all three again:
121297	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Stopped, started, listened. Stopped, started, listened.
132995	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, listen out for those 3 different pronunciations of the past simple <em>e-d</em> ending.
140956	Itâ€™s simple, isnâ€™t itâ€¦
142975	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes, well we are talking about the past simple, â€¦ but â€¦ irregular verbs are not quite so simple.
149928	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's true: can you give us some examples of irregular verbs, please, Neil?
155283	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I went to the interview yesterday and got the job!
159638	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And another one please?
163351	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Kurosawa made some wonderful films.
165623	<strong>Finn <br></strong>So the past simple of <em>go</em> is <em>went</em>.
170347	<strong>Sophie<br></strong><em>...get</em> is <em>got</em>.
172719	<strong>Finn<br></strong>...and <em>make</em> is <em>made</em>.
175170	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And Iâ€™m afraid you just have to learn irregular verbs.
178860	There is no one simple rule for them.
181123	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But the good news is that the past simple is the same for all people<em>.
187382	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes â€“ itâ€™s I got the job, you got the job, he got the jobâ€¦
192001	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We got the jobâ€¦ they got the job.
194740	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Everybody got the job!
196472	<strong>Both<br></strong>Hooray!
198575	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>Youâ€™re listening to BBC Learning English.
206281	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, for negatives in the past simpâ€¦ [sfx: loud sound of unwrapping of biscuit and someone taking a bite] â€¦Sophie, are you hungry?
213504	<strong>Sophie </strong>[munching] Yes, sorry, I didnâ€™t have breakfast this morning.
216580	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You didnâ€™t have breakfast! Aha!
220275	â€¦ past simple negatives â€¦ this is simpleâ€¦ you just put <em>didnâ€™t</em> in front of the main verb.
227219	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. <em>Didnâ€™t</em> plus the infinitive makes a past simple negative: <em>I didnâ€™t have breakfast this morning.
235516	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So remember: itâ€™s not <em>I didnâ€™t had</em>, itâ€™s I didnâ€™t have breakfast.
241764	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I didnâ€™t have breakfast. I didn't have time!
245448	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, letâ€™s move on to past simple questions. Hereâ€™s an example:
251101	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Did you make that cake? Itâ€™s delicious!
254353	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Did you say â€˜cakeâ€™? Where?
256073	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Sorry Sophie, it was just the example!
259069	So in past simple questions itâ€™s<em> did</em> plus subject plus an infinitive: <em>Did you make?
268380	Letâ€™s hear that again - with an answer this time:
271440	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Did you make that cake? Itâ€™s delicious!
274619	<strong>Finn<br></strong><em>Yes, I did.
277251	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Or we could say: <em>No, I didnâ€™t.
279700	For short answers, just drop the verb and use the subject with <em>did </em>or <em>didnâ€™t</em>, so itâ€™s <em>Yes, I did.
287008	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Or:<em> No, I didnâ€™t.
289413	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Good! Now for a quiz.
291246	Iâ€™ll say a sentence in the present simple and you change it to the past simple.
297706	Here goes: We start work at 10 in the morning. We start work at 10 in the morning.
302868	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Ok, in the past simple itâ€™s: We started work at 10 in the morning.
308596	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We started work at 10 in the morning. Great! Number 2.
309880	Hereâ€™s a sentence in the past simple: you have to make it negative. Ready?
316847	Scientists found a cure for the disease. <br>Scientists found a cure for the disease.
322026	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the answer is: <em>Scientists didnâ€™t find a cure for the disease.
327923	We change â€˜foundâ€™ to â€˜findâ€™ and put â€˜didnâ€™tâ€™ in front of the verb: Scientists didnâ€™t find a cure for the disease.
328485	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And finally, Iâ€™ll ask a past simple question.
332466	Can you give me a short answer. Sophie: Did you have breakfast this morning?
338772	Did you have breakfast this morning?
342442	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>No, I didnâ€™t. Or I could say: Yes, I did.
349078	Finn, what did you have for breakfast?
350939	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh, I had cereal, eggs, toast, orange juice â€¦ coffee, croissants â€¦.
356622	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Stop, stop!
358560	Iâ€™m so hungryâ€¦ [munching a biscuit]â€¦Thereâ€™s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
