1	(Introduction...)
11888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
15777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
17888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In this programme, we're talking about linking devices.
22288	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right! And there are lots of different kinds of linking devices, but today we're looking at ways of contrasting one idea with another.
30648	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, some words and phrases that do this are <strong>however</strong>, <strong>although</strong> and <strong>despite</strong>.
38065	We'll give you lots of information and examplesâ€¦
40933	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And of course there'll be a quiz to see what you've learnt.
44444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, here we go, with our first example sentences from Neil:
49828	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. Sometimes we completely disagreed.
55675	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Now the ideas in those two sentences contrast with each other a little bit.
61555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>The fact that they completely disagreed is slightly surprising or unexpected if they were the best of friends, isn't it?
69977	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It depends on the friendship but yes, it could be true.
73111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It could be.
74111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And to express this contrast clearly and in an interesting way, we can link the ideas in the sentences with the word <strong>but</strong>, like this:
84111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends, <strong>but</strong> sometimes we completely disagreed.
89666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or we can use the word <strong>however</strong>, like this:
93850	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. <strong>However</strong>, sometimes we completely disagreed.
100222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, <strong>however </strong>doesn't make two sentences into one long sentence, like the word <strong>but </strong>does.
107400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>No, as you heard, <strong>however </strong>usually goes at the start of a new sentence, or, we can sometimes put it at the end of a sentence, like this:
117257	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends. Sometimes we completely disagreed, <strong>however</strong>.
123100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. Now if we prefer to join the two sentences together into one longer sentence, we could use <strong>although</strong> or <strong>even though</strong>.
133695	And they express surprise more than <strong>however </strong>or<strong> but</strong>. Neil.
139300	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Although</strong> Dean and I were the best of friends, sometimes we completely disagreed.
144777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. The phrase <strong>even though</strong> works in exactly the same way.
150000	And you can use <strong>although</strong> and <strong>even though</strong> at the beginning or in the middle of this longer sentence:
157588	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Dean and I were the best of friends, <strong>even though</strong> sometimes we completely disagreed.
163800	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.
169623	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now let's take a look at <strong>despite</strong> and <strong>in spite of</strong>.
174300	They mean the same as each other but do they mean the same as <strong>although</strong> and <strong>even though</strong>?
180933	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Actually yes, they do. They're also used to link and contrast surprising or unexpected ideas and they can go at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence.
192222	But the grammar is slightly different. Listen:
195777	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Despite</strong> being the best of friends, Dean and I sometimes completely disagreed.
201444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So:<strong> despite </strong>isfollowed by the -ing form of the verb, <strong>despite being</strong>, We don't use a subject and a verb after <strong>despite</strong>.
212888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And <strong>in spite of</strong> is the same. We can also use a noun phrase instead of an â€“ing verb. Neil.
221800	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Despite</strong> our great friendship, Dean and I sometimes completely disagreed.
227222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. So the noun phrase after <strong>despite</strong> is <strong>our great friendship</strong>.
232700	And one more point about <strong>despite </strong>and <strong>in spite of</strong>.
236733	They can both be followed by the phrase <strong>the fact that </strong>plus a subject and a verb. Listen.
244111	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>In spite of the fact that</strong> Dean and I were the best of friends, sometimes we completely disagreed.
251333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. Now we'll finish with two more linking words, <strong>while </strong>and <strong>whereas</strong>.
257222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, these are a bit different. <strong>While </strong>and<strong> whereas </strong>are used mainly for contrasting facts.
264822	They don't usually express surprise or any other attitude. Examples please, Neil?
271888	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Whereas</strong> I studied zoology, Dean studied medieval history.
277222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that's a fact! And again, these words can go at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence. So we could also say:
286491	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I studied zoology <strong>while</strong> Dean studied medieval history.
291111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Very good. And now it's quiz time!
295700	Number one. Complete this sentence with either a) <strong>although</strong> or b)<strong>despite</strong>.
303333	We hardly ever saw our cousins _____ living very near each other.
309953	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>despite </strong>because it's followed by a verb-ing.

348700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's b) <strong>whereas</strong>. Honey is supposed to be good for you <strong>whereas</strong> sugar is considered bad.
