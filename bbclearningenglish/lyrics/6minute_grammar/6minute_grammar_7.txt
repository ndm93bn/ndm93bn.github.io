1	(Introduction...)
11963	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.
15503	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine.Hello.
16855	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello.In this programme we're talking about subject questions.
21970	We'll show you what they are, and how to make them.
24919	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And we'll have a quiz to test what you've learnt.
27651	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And we'll finish with a top pronunciation tip.
31603	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, let's get started.
33522	In everyday English, the words <strong>who</strong>, <strong>what</strong>, <strong>which</strong> and <strong>whose</strong> are very common in questions.
41516	Here's Neil, hello Neil.
43498	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello Catherine.
44418	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>With an example:
45518	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Who did David meet?
48057	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thanks Neil. Now the answer could be:
51685	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>David met Victoria.
54565	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Subject: David; verb: met; object: Victoria.
60700	So Victoria is the <em>object</em> of the <em>verb</em> met.
64782	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So in the question <strong>Who did David meet?
67893	The word <strong>who</strong> is asking about the <strong>object</strong>.
71647	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But we can also use question words to ask about the <strong>subject</strong>, like this:
77506	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Who lives in the White House?
80499	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, so we have a question word: who, plus a verb: lives.
86519	And it's a <strong>subject question</strong> because it asks who is <strong>doing</strong> the <strong>verb</strong>.
91752	<strong>Who lives in the White House?
94374	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now we don't use <strong>do</strong>, <strong>does</strong> or <strong>did</strong> in subject questions.
99676	We don't say <strong>Who does live</strong> â€“ it's just <strong>Who lives</strong>.
103789	So Catherine <strong>Who lives in the White House?
106134	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Tough one Rob. I think it's the US president.
109344	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, correct.
110115	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's have another one please.
111931	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>What makes you happy?
114776	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>What makes me happy?</strong>Knitting actually makes me happy!
119520	So this question word is <strong>what</strong>.
122526	<strong>What</strong> is the subject, and the verb is <strong>makes</strong>. Rob, what makes you happy?
129183	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's got to be riding my bike, I think.
132002	So that's <strong>who</strong> to ask about people, and <strong>what</strong> for things.
136603	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now, can we have nother one please Neil?
139154	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Which key opens this door?
143165	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, the question word <strong>which</strong> usually comes with a <strong>noun</strong>.
147999	For example: which key. <strong>Rob, which key opens this door?
152684	<strong>Rob <br></strong>The smallest key opens this door.
155469	We use <strong>which</strong> when the choice of possible answers is limited, like which key, or which day, or which colour.
164212	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And what if the choice of possible answers <strong>isn't</strong> limited?
168108	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, then we use <strong>what</strong> without a noun.
171269	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>What happened last night? What caused the accident?
177049	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
182450	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And we're looking at subject questions. Neil, can we have one more subject question word please?
189287	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Whose story won first prize?
193175	<strong>Rob<br></strong>The word whose shows that something <strong>belongs</strong> to someone, and it usually comes with a noun, so: whose story is the subject; the verb is won.
203674	<strong>Whose story won first prize?
206345	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now: a pronunciation warning.
209478	In spoken English, the words <strong>who is</strong> and the words <strong>who has</strong> are often shortened to:
218483	<strong>Both<br></strong><strong>Who's</strong>!!!
220301	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right: it sounds exactly the same as the question word <strong>whose</strong>.
225536	<strong>Who's</strong> - <strong>whose</strong>.
227037	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's confusing, isn't it? So here's a little tip for you.
230602	If you remember that the question word <strong>whose</strong> usually comes with a noun, you should be able to tell the difference.
237767	Here's Neil with two questions - but only one of them has a noun after the word <strong>whose</strong>.
243040	See if you can tell which one:
245840	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong><em>Who's</em></strong><em> using my mobile phone?
249267	<strong>Whose</strong> mobile phone has a signal?
253132	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Did you get that?
255226	The second question had <strong>whose</strong> plus a <strong>noun</strong> so that means it's a<strong> subject question</strong>: <strong>Whose mobile phone has a signal?
263679	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Top tip Rob.
264971	So now we have four words we can use for <strong>subject questions:</strong> <strong>who, which</strong>, <strong>what</strong>, and <strong>whose</strong>.
274689	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Do you know what, I think that means: it's quiz time.
278557	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And you're right, it is Rob.
280354	But actually, today we're doing a backwards quiz: I'll say the answer, and you at home have to work out what the subject question is.
292426	Here's the first answer: <em>Keiko speaks Japanese.
298710	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, the <strong>subject</strong> is Keiko - that's a person.
302735	It's <strong>who</strong> for people, so the question is <strong>Who speaks Japanese?
307816	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Here's another answer:<em> Kate's dog won the competition.
314059	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So it's <strong>whose</strong> because the dog belongs to Kate.
318522	With <strong>whose</strong> we need the noun dog, so: <strong>Whose dog won the competition?
324921	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, very good. And Kate's dog is a clever dog! No doubt about it.
329615	Right, last one: <strong>The shop on the corner sells gloves.
334738	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So it's <strong>which</strong> with shop because we're asking about a thing - and we can suppose there's a limited choice of shops in the area - so: <strong>Which shop sells gloves?
346808	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that's <strong>subject questions</strong>.
349443	They don't need the auxiliary <strong>do</strong>, <strong>does</strong> or <strong>did</strong>.
353182	<strong>Rob <br></strong>...but they all start with a question word.
356183	Just remember to choose the right one!
358563	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There's more about this on our website at www.bbclearningenglish.com.
