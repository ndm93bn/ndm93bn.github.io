12900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Finn.
16950	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me Catherine. In today's programme we're having a look at modal verbs.
23800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now modal verbs are used in a lot of different ways but in this programme weâ€™re looking at the modal verbs we use when we're talking about things we think are possible or true â€“ both in the present and in the past.
38570	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. When we don't know something for sure, we often make guesses.
43800	And modal verbs can express how sure or unsure we are about our guesses. We'll give you lots of examplesâ€¦
52500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And weâ€™ll check what you've learned in our quiz.
56610	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But first, we're listening to Fiona, who is a science reporter.
61970	And Fiona is talking about some ancient fossils that were found in China and Taiwan.
68050	<strong>Finn<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Are the fossils from humans?
75500	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Fiona<br></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan <strong>could be looking</strong> at something very important.
84010	It seems that the fossils <strong>can't be</strong> from any known human species.
89200	They <strong>might be</strong> the result of breeding between species or they <strong>may belong</strong> to an unknown human species.
96613	The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups <strong>may have lived</strong> there than previously thought.
109100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So that was Fiona. And we asked you: Are the fossils from humans?
114750	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: Maybe. They <strong>might be</strong> the result of breeding between species or they <strong>may belong</strong> to an unknown human species.
125173	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we don't know the answer for sure.
128200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now the modal verbs <strong>might</strong> and <strong>may </strong>plus an infinitive show that we're talking about a present possibility, not a certainty.
139921	The modal verb <strong>could</strong> does this too, either with an infinitive or with a continuous form.
147876	Here's an example.
149600	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>The research teams analysing fossils found in China and Taiwan <strong>could be looking</strong> at something very importantâ€¦
158900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In fact, we can say <strong>could be looking, might be looking</strong> or <strong>may be looking</strong> there.
166100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right: it's a modal verb plus the continuous form of <strong>be</strong> plus <strong>verbâ€“ing</strong>.
172700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But what about this sentence? Listen.
176900	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>It seems that the fossils <strong>can't be</strong> from any known human species.
182000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Fiona uses the modal <strong>canâ€™t </strong>there.
186000	Now we use <strong>can't </strong>with an infinitive when we believe strongly that something isn't possible.
192800	The researchers believe strongly that the fossils don't belong to any known human species.
199200	They <strong>can't</strong> come from a known human species â€“ it's not possible.
203600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So they <strong>must be</strong> from an unknown human species.
208480	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. <strong>Must </strong>or<strong> can't </strong>plus an infinitive both help us to express a strong belief that something is or isn't possible.
217700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>When we're less sure about something, we can say, for example, the fossils <strong>might not, mightnâ€™t </strong>or<strong> may not be</strong> from a known human species.
228100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, but donâ€™t use the negative <strong>couldn't</strong> like this. It's different.
232900	<strong>Couldn't</strong> plus an infinitive means that something is completely impossible. Right then.
239308	Now let's look at possibilities and certainties in the past. Here's the next clip.
245000	<strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br></strong>The fossils suggest that before modern humans arrived in Asia, more diverse human groups <strong>may have lived</strong> there than previously thought.
256100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we can also use <strong>might, may, could, can't</strong> and <strong>must</strong> with <strong>have</strong> and the past participle of the verb when we think something was possible in the past.
268900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, we can say <strong>may have lived, might have lived </strong>or<strong> could have lived</strong> to express past possibility.
275873	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we use<strong> can't </strong>or <strong>must </strong>with <strong>have</strong> and the past participle when we're <strong>certain</strong> about something in the past.
283907	For example, <strong>t</strong><strong>he scientists can't have expected to find anything so important</strong>.
289790	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. <strong>They must have been very excited</strong>.
293200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I'm sure they were!
294429	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.
300000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're talking about modal verbs.
302850	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's quiz time! For each of these sentences, choose <strong>might</strong>,<strong> must</strong> or <strong>canâ€™t</strong> to fill the gap: Number one: Finn, you got an A grade in physics?
317000	Wow. You _____ have studied really hard.
322999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is <strong>must</strong>. You must have studied really hard. I did Catherine.
329159	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Very good, Finn! Number two: Nick just called. He is stuck in traffic: he _____ be late.
337454	<strong>Finn</strong><br>And this one is <strong>might</strong>. <strong>He might be late</strong>.
342070	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done! Number three: You _____ have seen a ghost. There's no such thing.
347810	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is <strong>can't.
351083	<strong>You canâ€™t have seen a ghost.</strong>There's no such thing. Is there Catherine?
355800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I don't think so, Finn. What about you?
357600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No. <br><strong>Catherine<br></strong>We donâ€™t believe in ghosts.
359427	And that's the end of the quiz. I hope you got them all right.
