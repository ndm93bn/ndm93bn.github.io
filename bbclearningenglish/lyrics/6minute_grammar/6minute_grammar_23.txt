13000	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil.
16400	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And me, Catherine. Today, we're talking about the <strong>past perfect continuous</strong> tenseâ€¦
23222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ which we use to give background information to an event in the past. We'll give you lots of examples.
29247	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We'll explain when to use the past perfect simple instead of the past perfect continuousâ€¦
35222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ and of course we'll finish with a quiz.
37530	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's start with an example. Hereâ€™s Finn.
40714	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Joe and Alice got together in 2012. Joe had been living in London for two years when they met.
48666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, we use the past perfect continuous to talk about something that was happening before another event or situation in the past.
57650	We can use it when we want to say how long this earlier action was happening for.
63304	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, in this case <strong>Joe</strong> <strong>had been living</strong> tells us what Joe was doing up to the time he met Alice.
70766	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. And the later action <strong>when they met</strong> was in the past simple. Let's hear that example again.
78333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Joe and Alice got together in 2012. Joe had been living in London for two years when they met.
85277	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Here's another example. Which action happened first?
89000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We had been trying to open the door for five minutes when I finally found the key.
94700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So <strong>we had been trying</strong>, in the past perfect continuous, was the earlier action.
100444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Sometimes, the action or situation that happens first in time comes second in the sentence. Listen to this:
110000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Jack ran the marathon in less than three hours. He had been training for it since 2010.
116684	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, the past perfect continuous phrase <strong>he had been training </strong>came in the second part of the sentence, but it happened earlier in time.
125666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. And the event that happened later in time: <strong>Jack</strong> <strong>ran the marathon</strong>, was in the past simple and came first in the sentence.
135111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Right. So, here's another sentence. Can you work out which action or happened first?
141796	<strong>Finn<br></strong>He missed the train, which he'd been hoping to catch.
145727	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The earlier action was <strong>heâ€™d been hoping</strong>.
149359	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. So, in that example the past perfect continuous was in a relative clause: <strong>which he had been hoping</strong>â€¦
157204	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's quite common with the past perfect continuous. And another common structure to use with past perfect continuous is a time conjunction, like this:
166824	<strong>Finn<br></strong>After I had been swimming for an hour, I was so cold I had to stop.
172333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, we had <strong>after</strong> plus <strong>I had been swimming.
176444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and that is the past perfect continuous in relative clauses and after time conjunctions.
182700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, we form the past perfect continuous with <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>had been </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong> of the main verb.
192030	Here are those examples again, Finn.
194707	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Joe had been livingâ€¦ Weâ€™d been tryingâ€¦ I had been swimmingâ€¦
199951	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>For negative sentences, it's <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>hadn't been </strong>and the present participle.
206595	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I hadn't been waiting very long when the bus arrived.
210869	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And don't forget those short forms: <strong>I had</strong> becomes <strong>I'd</strong>;<strong> We had </strong>is<strong> we'd</strong>;<strong> had not </strong>is<strong> hadn't</strong> and so on.
221444	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.
227071	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about the past perfect continuous.
230666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We often use it to give background information about a situation or event that was happening up to another event in the pastâ€¦
238600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ which is usually in the past simple.
241133	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Sometimes we can use either the past perfect simple or the past perfect continuous, particularly for activities that continue for a long time, like <strong>work, run </strong>or <strong>sleep</strong>.
252840	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we can say:
254122	<strong>Finn</strong><br> Patrick felt refreshed because <strong>he had slept</strong> all afternoon.
258973	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> Or we can say:
260600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Patrick felt refreshed because <strong>he had been sleeping</strong> all day.
265335	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But if the earlier action had been completed, then we use the past perfect simple.
271401	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>I'd</strong> already <strong>cooked</strong> supper when Jan got home.
275100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>If the earlier action is incomplete, use the past perfect continuous, to focus on the process or length of time that the action continued, rather than the end result.
287036	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And, now it's time for our quiz.
291722	Which is correct? Number one: a) I'd only been waiting a few minutes when the bus arrived.
299669	b) I only waited a few minutes when the bus had arrived.
307777	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> Itâ€™s a). We need the past perfect continuous for the earlier action or situation.
314221	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Correct. Number 2: a) After they'd been walking for three hours, they realised they were lost.
322117	b) After they walked for three hours, they'd realised they were lost.
331663	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's a) again. The earlier action was the walking, so that's in the past perfect continuous.
338900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Good, finally, number 3: a) Sam finally bought the car that he'd saved up for.
345555	b) Sam finally bought the car that he'd been saving up for.
353416	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And this time, both are correct.
356555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. Well done if you got them all right.
