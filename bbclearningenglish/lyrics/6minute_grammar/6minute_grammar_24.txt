11800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello, and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
15055	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.
17314	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And today we're talking about six different ways of talking about the future â€“ like <strong>will </strong>and <strong>be going to</strong>.
24900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We can also use the <strong>present simple</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong> tenses, and we're going to share a couple of other ways as wellâ€¦
33255	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right and as usual, there'll be a quiz at the end to test what you've learned.
38100	So let's get started. First, weâ€™ll look at <strong>will</strong> and <strong>be going to</strong>.
44036	They're both very common, and a lot of the time they're used in a similar way, to talk about predictions.
50650	But not always. So â€“ let's hear an example of <strong>be going to</strong> â€“ Finn, a question for you: what's for dinner tonight?
59924	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hmmmâ€¦ <strong>I'm</strong> <strong>going to cook</strong> my favourite meal.
63799	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I know what that is.
64944	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thatâ€™s curry! I've got all the ingredients already. And you, Catherine? What about you?
71666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I haven't made any plans â€“ <strong>I'll</strong> probably just have something simpleâ€¦ like tomato soup.
77900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ooh, sounds yummy.
79111	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Yeah. So - Finn <strong>is</strong> <strong>going to</strong> cook curry.
83444	He already knew his plan at the time of speaking. Itâ€™s his intention â€“ or his plan â€“ to cook curry.
90800	And we often use <strong>be going to</strong> in this way.
94600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And Catherine â€“ what did you say about tomato soup, again?
98703	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I saidâ€¦ <strong>I'll </strong>probably have something simpleâ€¦ like tomato soup.
104166	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, so Catherine used <strong>Iâ€™ll</strong> or <strong>will -</strong> <strong>I will </strong>â€“ but she made her decision at the time of speaking â€“ so this is one of the main differences between <strong>will</strong> and <strong>going to</strong>.
116224	Ok, so we have four more ways of talking about the future to look atâ€¦.
120924	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>We do and we have to talk some more about your curry, Finn, at this point. So <strong>are you eating </strong>alone?
127504	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No, <strong>I'm eating </strong>with a couple of friends.
130888	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Aha! Now this time my question and Finn's answer are both in the <strong>present continuous</strong> â€“ but weâ€™re using the present continuous to talk about the future.
141788	We use the present continuous for arrangements like this â€“ so Finn has arranged to eat with friends.
148888	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Yes. <strong> I'm eating</strong> with friends.
151440	And you know, we could also use <strong>be going to</strong> for this as well, but not <strong>will.</strong>
156999	So I could say: <strong>I'm going to</strong> <strong>eat</strong> with a couple of friends.
161222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So thatâ€™s three ways, and now thereâ€™s another present tense we can use to talk about the future and thatâ€™s the <strong>present simple</strong>. So curry time again, Finn.
172444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Letâ€™s talk about curry!
173700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>When are your friends coming to dinner?
176311	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, my friends are passing through London on a very tight schedule.
181444	So <strong>they arrive</strong> at the station at 5pm, <strong>we eat</strong> dinner at 6pm, and <strong>they leave</strong> on a plane at 9pm the same night!
191666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>How exciting! And that conveniently demonstrates why we use the present simple for future events â€“ we use it to talk about timetables.
202222	<strong>Your friends arrive</strong> at the station at 5pm, <strong>we eat</strong> dinner at 6pm, and <strong>they leave </strong>on a plane at 9pm the same night.
212400	And these are all things that are planned to happen at specific times.
217316	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Right. Now Catherine, it's your turn to use our next form â€“ <strong>be about to</strong> â€“ to talk about your dinner plans, OK?
226222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. <strong>I'm</strong> <strong>about to</strong> say something about tomato soup.
230000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK, youâ€™re about to. OK, very good, very clever.
232913	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. So we use <strong>be about to</strong>, for things in the very near future.
238431	And <strong>be about to</strong> is followed by the base form of a verb. So the film <strong>is about to start.
245666	Or the train <strong>is about to leave,</strong> things like that.
249500	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Great! So weâ€™ve now looked at five ways of talking about the future. What about the sixth?
255058	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Well, the sixth way isn't actually a tense, itâ€™s not even a phrase â€“ it's just a group of normal everyday verbs.
262900	And now itâ€™s time to bring in Callum whoâ€™s been waiting patiently.
266850	Listen carefully for the verbs that Callum uses to talk about the future.
271850	<strong>Callum<br></strong>I <strong>plan</strong> <strong>to do</strong> evening classes in coding.
275555	I <strong>aim</strong> <strong>to finish</strong> all the preparation by 8pm.
279888	Wang Chun <strong>intends to move</strong> to Berlin.
283888	We've <strong>arranged</strong> <strong>to meet</strong> in person next spring.
287888	She <strong>decided</strong> <strong>to take</strong> the money.
291111	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Good. So we heard <strong>plan</strong>, <strong>aim</strong>, <strong>intend</strong>, <strong>arrange</strong> and <strong>decide</strong>.
298311	In fact, lots of verbs can be used like this â€“ followed by <strong>to</strong> and <strong>the base form of a verb</strong> â€“ to talk about the future.
306000	So listen out for them! Oh, and thank you Callum.
308777	<strong>Callum</strong><br>You're welcome.
309888	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar, from BBC Learning English.
315555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now, it's quiz time! Question one.
319098	If you've already made a plan to visit France, which is better?
324333	a) I will travel to France this year or b) I'm going to travel to France this year?
331777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>The answer is b) I'm going to travel to France this year. Number two.
339200	a) We're about to get married next summer or b) We plan to get married next summer.
347156	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the correct answer is b) We plan to get married next summer.
351934	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got all those right.
356618	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done indeed and itâ€™s also the end of the show.
