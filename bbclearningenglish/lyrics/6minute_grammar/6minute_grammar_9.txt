1	(Introduction...)
11897	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neilâ€¦
14688	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
16284	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>In this programme weâ€™re looking at six different English tenses.
22202	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And our first tense is: the present simple. So, Neil, a question: Where do you live?
28465	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>I live</strong> in London.
30388	And the present simple <strong>I live</strong> tells us that this is a fact, or a permanent situation.
36815	London is home.
39048	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good - and as well as facts, we use the present simple for regular activities too, with phrases like <strong>every day</strong> or <strong>on Saturdays</strong>.
48856	For example <strong>we bring you 6 Minute Grammar on Tuesdays</strong>!
52904	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Indeed, and words like <strong>usually</strong>, <strong>sometimes</strong>, <strong>always</strong>, and<strong> often</strong> go with the present simple.
61133	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hereâ€™s Harry with an example.
63066	<strong>Harry <br></strong><strong>6 Minute Grammar usually finishes</strong> with a quiz!
67112	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Thatâ€™s true, it does. And our second tense is: the present continuous.
71751	<strong>Neil <br></strong>Yes, and one of the uses of the present continuous tense to talk about activities happening now.
78253	Hereâ€™s Harry, with an example.
80580	<strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>Youâ€™re listening</strong> to 6 Minute Grammar right now.
83645	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thatâ€™s an activity happening now. But hereâ€™s a different example.
88874	<strong>Harry<br></strong>Iâ€™m from near Bristol, but <strong>Iâ€™m living</strong> in London at the moment.
92800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The present continuous <strong>Iâ€™m living </strong>tells us that this is a temporary situation.
98491	London isnâ€™t Harryâ€™s permanent home.
101444	With this use of the present continuous, look out for time expressions like <strong>at the moment, this year, these days</strong>.
110232	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And a sentence like <strong>Iâ€™m studying Russian this month</strong> doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m studying it right this minute.
116844	It means Iâ€™m doing it off and on, around this time.
119850	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So far so good.
121418	But Neil: if we use the present continuous tense for things happening now, why do we say things like <strong>I understand</strong> and <strong>that coffee smells good</strong>?
133553	Thatâ€™s happening now - but we used the present simple.
137046	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Good question! And the answer is, some verbs donâ€™t take a continuous form.
143442	Theyâ€™re often verbs of thinking or feeling like <strong>understand</strong> or <strong>smell, </strong>or<strong> know, believe, remember, hear, sound, want, need.</strong>
156346	We keep them in the simple tense.
159019	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.
165082	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about tenses.
167873	Now for tenses three and four: thatâ€™s the past simple and the present perfect.
173061	And our examples are from a postcard that our colleague Finn sent us â€“ and heâ€™s on holiday in India, the lucky man.
180408	So Harry, can you read it for us please?
182549	<strong>Harry<br></strong>Hello from Goa! <strong> Have you ever been </strong>here?
186128	<strong> We arrived</strong> two days ago.
188205	<strong>Itâ€™s been</strong> really hot <strong>since</strong> then.
190425	<strong>Iâ€™ve already done</strong> some sunbathing but we <strong>havenâ€™t seen much yet.
194578	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Lucky Finn. So: letâ€™s look at the tenses.
198087	The sentence<strong> we arrived</strong> <strong>two days ago</strong> is past simple.
202703	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes: use the past simple when something clearly finished in the past.
207570	It often goes with phrases like <strong>two days ago</strong>,<strong> yesterday</strong>,and<strong> last month</strong>.
213774	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But with the present perfect, we donâ€™t usually say when things happened.
219359	We just want to know whether something has happened or not.
222120	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, Finnâ€™s sentences <strong>Iâ€™ve already done some sunbathing </strong>and <strong>we havenâ€™t seen much yet</strong> are good examples of this.
230692	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. And the words <strong>already, yet</strong> and <strong>just</strong> often go with the present perfect.
237759	Examples please Harryâ€¦
239021	<strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>Have you ever been</strong> here? <strong>Itâ€™s been</strong> really hot <strong>since</strong> then.
243644	<strong>Neil<br></strong>With the present perfect, weâ€™re interested in past experiences more than past times or dates.
251314	So we use <strong>ever</strong> and <strong>never</strong>. <strong>Have you ever been </strong>to Goa, Catherine?
256145	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>No:<strong> Iâ€™ve never been</strong> to Goa Neil. Iâ€™d like to, but I never have.
260298	And if we need to talk about when things happened, we can use the words <strong>for</strong> and <strong>since</strong> with the present perfect.
267749	Finn<strong>â€™s been </strong>in Goa <strong>for two days</strong>; and it<strong>â€™s been </strong>really hot <strong>since he arrived</strong>.
274690	Now for our next tense, and hereâ€™s Harry with more of Finnâ€™s postcard.
279839	<strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>Weâ€™re going to visit</strong> the market <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and weâ€™re coming home <strong>next Wednesday</strong>.
285329	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We use<strong> going to with an infinitive verb </strong>for things you plan or expect to happen.
291169	Finn has a plan to visit the market tomorrow.
294388	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and Finn also says <strong>weâ€™re coming home next Wednesday</strong>.
298699	And thatâ€™s tense six, the present continuous for future arrangements.
303780	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. Itâ€™s like <strong>going to</strong> but itâ€™s a definite arrangement.
307025	Heâ€™s probably got his plane tickets.
309204	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. So thatâ€™s our six tenses. And now itâ€™s quiz time!!
315548	Question one. Which is correct?
318111	Is it a) <strong>Iâ€™m needing</strong> some new shoes or b) <strong>I need</strong> some new shoes?
323997	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Itâ€™s b) <strong>I need</strong> some new shoes.
327280	Question two: which is correct: a) <strong>Did you see</strong> Luke since Saturday?
333377	Or b) <strong>Have you seen</strong> Luke since Saturday?
337478	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s b) <strong>Have you seen</strong> Luke since Saturday.
341036	And the last one: which is correct? Is it a) Itâ€™s <strong>going to rain</strong> tomorrow.
346362	Or b) <strong>Itâ€™s raining</strong> tomorrow.
348812	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Itâ€™s a) <strong>Itâ€™s going to rain</strong> tomorrow.
352828	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done if you got those right. That brings us to the end of the programme.
