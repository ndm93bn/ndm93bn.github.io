1	(Introduction...)
10444	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.
13600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. In this programme weâ€™re talking about multi-word verbs.
17888	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes, these are verbs that are <strong>made up </strong>of more than one word.
21931	There is a main verb followed by one or two particles, which might be adverbs or prepositions.
27111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Multi-word verbs are incredibly important. They're used all the time in spoken English and often in written English.
35666	So if you want to have a good understanding of English and want to be able to express yourself naturally, itâ€™s a good idea to know your multi-word verbs.
47116	<strong>Callum<br></strong>There are different types of multi-word verbs and today weâ€™re looking at four types of prepositional verbs and phrasal verbs.
54800	And to keep things simpler weâ€™ll refer to them all as phrasal verbs.
58444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Letâ€™s start with a clip from Dave. And Dave is talking about his holiday.
63555	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And listen for the answer to this question: Why did Dave have to stay in bed?
69222	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Dave<br></strong>It wasnâ€™t the holiday I was expecting.
72217	On the first day, I <strong>picked up</strong> a nasty bug.
75135	I think I <strong>picked it up</strong> from something I ate. Anyway, I had to stay in bed.
80361	It took me a few days to <strong>get over</strong> that. Then my girlfriend and I <strong>split up</strong>.
85222	Well, we hadnâ€™t been <strong>getting along</strong> well for some time.
88089	I guess we just couldnâ€™t <strong>put up with</strong> each other for any longer.
95555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, that was Dave using a lot of phrasal verbs.
99333	Now the question was: Why did Dave have to stay in bed, Callum?
103505	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And the answer is: Because he <strong>picked up</strong> a nasty bug.
107222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, <strong>picked up</strong> is a phrasal verb that means <strong>caught </strong>here.
111951	He picked up a nasty bug: he caught an unpleasant illness.
116444	<strong>Callum<br></strong>To <strong>pick up</strong> is an example of a type one phrasal verb.
120919	These phrasal verbs are transitive which means they always have an object.
125888	Without an object it doesnâ€™t make sense so there has to be <strong>something</strong> that is <strong>picked up</strong>.
131222	In this example, the object of <strong>picked up</strong> is <strong>a nasty bug</strong>.
135555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And with type 1 phrasal verbs, you can put the object after the particle or between the verb and the particle.
143555	<strong>Callum<br></strong>So you can say <strong>I picked up a nasty bug</strong> or <strong>I picked a nasty bug up</strong>.
148444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But if you use an object pronoun like <strong>it</strong>, <strong>him, </strong>or<strong> her, </strong>it <strong>must</strong> go between the verb and the particle.
157693	<strong>Callum<br></strong>As we heard Dave say about the bug, he <strong>picked it up</strong> from something he ate. Not he picked up it.
165222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. Now listen for another phrasal verb in this clip.
169098	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1 <br></strong>It took me a few days to <strong>get over</strong> that.
171729	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now <strong>get over</strong> is our second type of phrasal verb.
176130	To get over something means to feel better after an illness or an upsetting event.
181700	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Itâ€™s transitive too, so it always has an object but unlike type 1 phrasal verbs the object or the object pronoun must come after the particle.
193222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. You canâ€™t separate the verb and the particle.
196777	Unlike Dave and his girlfriend! What phrasal verb does he use for that?
202000	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>Then my girlfriend and I <strong>split up</strong>.
204555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. Itâ€™s not very nice to <strong>split up</strong> on holiday, is it?
208549	And <strong>split up</strong> is a type three phrasal verb. What do we need to know about type threes, Callum?
215200	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Well, theyâ€™re intransitive. That means that they donâ€™t have an object and you canâ€™t split the two parts of the phrasal verb.
223111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Dave used another type three. Listen again.
226888	<strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br></strong>Well, we hadnâ€™t been <strong>getting along</strong> well for some time.
229440	<strong>Callum<br></strong><strong>Getting along</strong> is also intransitive.
232323	Thereâ€™s no object. And what does it mean?
234444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>If two people <strong>get along</strong> it means that they like each other and have a good relationship with each other.
240222	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Next clip please.
241333	<strong>INSERT CLIP 4<br></strong>I guess we just couldnâ€™t <strong>put up with</strong> each other for any longer.
245286	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And thereâ€™s our fourth type of phrasal verb. There are three parts to it.
250200	Thereâ€™s <strong>put</strong> followed by the particles <strong>up</strong> and <strong>with</strong>.
254552	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And thereâ€™s an object, <strong>each other</strong>.
257888	Like type two phrasal verbs the object must always come after the particles.
263640	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And finally some phrasal verbs are both type 3 and type 4.
269666	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes. Do you remember that Dave and his girlfriend hadnâ€™t been <strong>getting along</strong>?
273542	Well, you could also say that they hadnâ€™t been <strong>getting along with</strong> each other.
278666	We can sometimes extend the type three phrasal verbs to become type four. So Catherine, how do you know which type a phrasal verb is?
288555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, if you see it or hear it being used, you can usually work it out but also a good dictionary will tell you whether itâ€™s transitive or not.
297626	So I recommend whenever you note a new phrasal verb you also write down some examples and what type it is.
304999	<strong>STING</strong>
310666	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Itâ€™s quiz time!
312839	Number one: right or wrong? When Dave got ill, it took him a few days to get it over.
321111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And thatâ€™s wrong. It should have been <strong>get over it</strong>.
325333	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Excellent! Number two: finish the sentence. Daveâ€™s off work.
330000	a) He picked up a cold. <br>b) He picked a cold up. <br>c) both a) and b) are possible.
339812	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answerâ€™s c), both a) and b) are possible.
345100	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Number three: Which is correct? <br>a) Dave and I get along well. <br>b) I get along well Dave. <br>c) I get Dave along well.
356767	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer's a) Dave and I get along well.
360555	<strong>Callum<br></strong>It is! And brilliant, well done if you got them all right.
