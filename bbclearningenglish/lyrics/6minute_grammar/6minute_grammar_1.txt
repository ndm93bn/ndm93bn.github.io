12299	<strong>Finn</strong><strong> <br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
15779	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And me, Alice. Hello.
18747	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And today we're talking about the present perfect tense.
22434	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's right: the present perfect tense.
25245	When we use it, how to form it, how to make negatives and questionsâ€¦
30095	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We'll look at the words <strong>ever</strong> and <strong>never</strong><em>â€¦</em>
33369	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And we'll have some pronunciation tips.
35418	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And there'll be a quiz at the end of the show, so keep listening!
42446	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Let's get started with some present perfect sentences. Hello Catherine!
47131	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello.
47698	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Some example sentences pleaseâ€¦
49807	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I've seen Miley Cyrus in concert. Janie has travelled all over the world.
57037	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thank you, Catherine.
58541	So one way we use the present perfect tense is to talk about life experience: things we've done at some time in the past.
68211	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's right and we make the present perfect tense with a subject, plus <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong><em>,</em> plus a past participle.
75655	Once more please Catherine.
77819	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I've seen Miley Cyrus in concert. Janie has travelled all over the world.
83944	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Now we don't say when this experience happened, because with the present perfect, we are interested in the experience itself.
91962	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. The present perfect often focusses on what happened, not when it happened.
98517	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Ok. So Finn, ask me a question about something I've done.
103677	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ok. <strong>Have you seen Skyfall?</strong>
108527	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Have I seen Skyfall?</strong> The James Bond film?
113321	<strong> Yes, I have: I've seen it three times.
116558	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Three times, eh? So with the present perfect we don't say when, but we can say how many times the experience happened.
124776	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Now, let's look at <strong>ever</strong> and <strong>never</strong>.
127868	They basically mean 'at any time in someone's life'.
131832	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Ever</strong> is very common in questions.
135444	Alice:<strong> Have you ever eaten sushi?
139704	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Yes, I have.</strong> I love sushi.
142702	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Me too. And Alice, have you <strong>ever</strong> ridden a camel?
147742	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No Finn, no: I have never ridden a camel.
152174	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, actually, neither have I.
154239	And we use <strong>never</strong> to talk about life experiences that we haven't had.
159678	<strong> Alice has never ridden a camel.</strong>
162734	Though I think you should try it: I hear it's fun!
165344	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Really? Let's do it together.
167877	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, ok.
168734	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Let's look at pronunciation. We use lots of short forms with present perfect.
174839	<strong>Finn<br></strong>First, <strong>I have </strong>is often shortened to <strong>I've</strong>.
180661	<strong>I have </strong>read that book becomesâ€¦
183393	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>I've read </strong>that book.
185310	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And <strong>has</strong> becomes just a <strong>s</strong> or a <strong>z </strong>sound.
190453	So instead of <strong>Janie has </strong>travelled it'sâ€¦
194623	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Janie's </strong>travelled.
196383	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And as for negatives: we make them by putting <strong>not </strong>between <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> and the past participle.
204708	But we can shorten <strong>have not</strong> to <strong>haven't</strong> and <strong>has not</strong> to <strong>hasn't</strong>. sCatherine.
212920	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I <strong>haven't</strong> seen all the Bond films.
215763	Rachel <strong>hasn't</strong> taught English in Japan.
220178	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, in sentences with <strong>never</strong>, the subject and <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> can be shortened.
226607	<strong>I have</strong> becomes <strong>I've</strong><em>, </em>and <strong>he has</strong> becomes <strong>he's</strong>. Catherine
233191	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>I've</strong> never heard of Sportlobster.
237255	Poor Alice â€“ <strong>She's</strong> never ridden a camel!
241638	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
245726	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're talking about the present perfect tense.
250522	Alice, now ask me a question about my life experiences.
254769	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Okâ€¦ <strong>Finn, have you seen Skyfall?
259459	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, a negative answer would be <strong>No, I haven't</strong>.
263979	But my answer is: <strong>Yes I have</strong>. Guess how many times I've seen Skyfall?
269852	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Okâ€¦ I think <strong>you've seen it</strong> five times.
273435	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Noâ€¦ not five times.
275077	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Ok. <strong>How many times have you seen Skyfall</strong>?
278873	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>I've seen Skyfall</strong> 20 timesâ€¦ I <strong>watched</strong> the DVD last night; I <strong>saw</strong> it on TV last week; and I <strong>saw</strong> it at the cinema when it first came outâ€¦
289561	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Ok, Finn â€“ we get the pictureâ€¦ When we answer a present perfect question about our experience, we can add a past simple sentence to give more information â€“ like saying when the experience happened.
305187	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Quiz time?! So here's question one â€“ and play along at home if you want.
311150	<strong>Alice, </strong>you have to answer with <strong>never</strong>.
315765	So: <strong>Have you ever seen a ghost?
319635	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>No, I've never seen a ghost.
322748	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Are you sure?
323393	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Maybe.
325186	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, for question two, answer with <strong>times.
328431	How many times have you eaten sushi?
332512	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>I've eaten sushi about a million times.
335501	<strong>Finn<br></strong>About a million times? Really? Only a million?
339596	Now for question three, I need a short answer.
343619	<strong>Have you ever visited BBC Learning English on Facebook?
349604	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Yes, I have!
