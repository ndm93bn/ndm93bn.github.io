1	(Introduction...)
12483	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
16310	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. In this programme we're talking about the words <strong>all, every, each, both, either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>.
28600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>...also known as quantifiers. So let's start by listening to Darren.
35900	He's been talking about how to choose a tablet.
39700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Why do customers have difficulty choosing a tablet?
47115	<strong>INSERT <br></strong><strong>Darren<br></strong>Should you have <strong>either</strong> this one <strong>or</strong> that one?
51200	<strong>All</strong> customers choosing a tablet ask themselves that question because <strong>each</strong> tablet is slightly different.
58843	Take the Apik 1 and the Negus 2.
62200	<strong>Both</strong> tablets have similar specs. While <strong>neithe</strong>r tablet is heavy, the Negus 2 is lighter.
69400	This could make a difference <strong>every </strong>time you go out.
72777	<strong>Each of</strong> the tablets has 2 gigabytes of RAM, but the Negus 2 is the faster device. And then thereâ€™s the cost.
81420	While <strong>neither of </strong>them seems much better than the other, the Negus 2 is considerably cheaper.
89222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That was Darren. So we asked you: Why do buyers have difficulty choosing tablets?
96006	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: Because <strong>each</strong> tablet has slightly different features.
100788	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now <strong>each</strong>,<strong> every</strong> and <strong>all</strong> can mean the full amount or total number of something.
109400	So we could also say <strong>every tablet </strong>or <strong>all tablets</strong>.
114000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Each</strong> and <strong>every </strong>are followed by a singular noun and verb.
118888	We say <strong>each tablet has </strong>and<strong> every tablet</strong> <strong>has</strong> - but <strong>all</strong> is followed by a plural noun and verb, so itâ€™s <strong>all tablets have</strong>.
130777	We could also say <strong>all the tablets have</strong>, but we donâ€™t use <strong>the</strong> with <strong>each</strong> or <strong>every</strong>.
138200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK. Thereâ€™s also a slight difference in meaning between <strong>every</strong> and <strong>each</strong>.
144444	We often use <strong>each</strong> when we're thinking about the individual members of a group.
149600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. So to talk about about the features of individual tablets, Darren said <strong>each tablet</strong>.
156263	But here's what he said later on.
159094	<strong>INSERT<br>Darren<br></strong>This could make a difference <strong>every time</strong> you go out.
162626	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There he's thinking about all the times, not individual times.
168160	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. Listen for more quantifiers in this clip.
172100	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Darren <br></strong>Should you have <strong>either</strong> this one <strong>or</strong> that one?
175861	<strong>Both</strong> tablets have similar specs. While <strong>neithe</strong>r tablet is heavy, the Negus 2 is lighter.
183100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There we heard the words <strong>either</strong>,<strong> neither</strong>, or as some people say, <strong>either</strong>, <strong>neither</strong>, and <strong>both.
190666	We use these quantifiers to talk about two people or things.
194750	So in the phrase <strong>Both tablets have similar specs, Both tablets</strong> means <strong>this tablet and the other tablet</strong>.
204444	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Neither tablet is heavy</strong>. That means <strong>not this one and not the other one</strong>.
210472	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Darren asked: <strong>Should you have either this one or that one?
215127	<strong>Either</strong> is used mainly in questions and negatives, to indicate a choice between two, or sometimes more than two, options.
223741	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. Let's take a quick look at the verbs we use after <strong>both</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>. Listen.
230667	<strong>Both the tablets have </strong>similar specs. <strong>Neither tablet is </strong>heavy.
236818	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So after <strong>both</strong>, the verb is positive and plural â€“ <strong>have</strong>.
242604	But after <strong>either</strong> and <strong>neither</strong>, the verb is positive and singular - <strong>is</strong>.
249581	Let's have another clip.
251865	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Darren<br></strong><strong>Each of</strong> the tablets has 2 gigabytes of RAM, but the Negus 2 is the faster device.
258621	While <strong>neither of </strong>them seems much better than the other, the Negus 2 is considerably cheaper.
264518	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we heard<strong> each of the tablets </strong>and<strong> neither of them.
268571	You can use<strong> all</strong>,<strong> each</strong>,<strong> neither</strong>,<strong> either </strong>and<strong> both </strong>with <strong>of</strong> and a plural noun phrase â€“ like <strong>the tablets</strong> â€“ or with a pronoun â€“ like <strong>them.
281576	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes. So you could say <strong>both of the tablets</strong> or <strong>both of them</strong>.
286991	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes and in this case,<strong> each of the tablets </strong>means the same as<strong> both of the tablets.
292700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Because there are only two.
294800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly.
296000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But we say <strong>each of the tablets has</strong> - thatâ€™s a singular verb - but <strong>both of the tablets have </strong>- and that's a plural verb.

312756	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's quiz time! Number one: Which is correct: a) Both of us lives in London.

330100	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And let's do number two: Which is correct?
333414	a) Neither of us likes the countryside.
336827	Or b) Neither of us doesn't like the countryside.
340400	<strong>Finn</strong><br>This oneâ€¦ is a) Neither of us likes the countryside.
346906	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number three: Which is correct?

352364	Or b) Answer each of the questions.
