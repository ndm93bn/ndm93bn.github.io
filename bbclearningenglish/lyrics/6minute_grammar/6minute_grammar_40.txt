1	(Introduction...)
11549	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Hello again. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.
15732	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>And me, Emma. Hello.
17234	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>In today's programme, we're talking about three little words: <strong>a</strong>, <strong>an</strong> and <strong>the</strong>.
23175	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Also known as <strong>articles</strong>. So let's start by saying hello to Finn.
27944	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Hello.
28538	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>And Finn, you're going to tell us about your time in Phnom Penh, which is the capital city of Cambodia.
35567	Listen out for the words <strong>a</strong>, <strong>an</strong> and <strong>the</strong>.
40355	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Yes, I was living in <strong>a</strong> flat near the city centre.
46133	I was lucky because every morning I saw <strong>an</strong> elephant walk past my front door.
52956	<strong>The</strong> elephant was giving rides to tourists.
56648	<strong>The</strong> owner told me that her name was Sambo.
60166	I discovered later that she was <strong>the</strong> only elephant in Phnom Penh.
65227	Here's <strong>a</strong> photo.
66998	<strong>Rob/Emma</strong> <br>Ahhh.
69572	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And quite a few articles there. We had <strong>a</strong> flat and <strong>a </strong>photo.
75540	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Yes, we use <strong>a </strong>before singular nouns. <strong>A </strong>flat and <strong>a</strong> photo.
82146	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>...but in spoken English it's <strong>'uh'</strong> not <strong>'a'</strong>.
85894	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>I was living in <strong>a flat</strong>. Here's <strong>a photo</strong>.
91154	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Now, Finn also said he saw <strong>an</strong> elephant.
95313	Not <strong>a</strong> elephant. <strong>An</strong> elephant.
98929	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>That's because 'elephant' begins with 'e'.
101592	We use <strong>an</strong>, not <strong>a,</strong> before nouns that begin with 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' - and most words starting with 'u'.
110621	We say <strong>an apple, an elephant, an ice-cream, an orange, an uncle.
117134	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>But in spoken English, <strong>an</strong> sounds like '<strong>un</strong>'. Finn.
122109	<strong>Finn</strong> <br><strong>An apple, an elephant, an ice-cream, an orange, an uncle.
130458	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Now let's look at <strong>the</strong> [thuh] and <strong>the</strong> [thee]. Finn said:
135769	<strong>Finn</strong> <br><strong>The elephant</strong> was giving rides to tourists.
139372	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Yes, and it's <strong>the elephant</strong> because it's the second time he mentions the elephant:
144822	<strong>Rob</strong> <br><strong>A</strong> first time, and <strong>the</strong> [thuh] or <strong>the</strong> [thee] second time.
148819	And it's <strong>the</strong> [thee] not <strong>the</strong> [thuh] with elephant because elephant starts with 'e'. Finn.
156062	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>I saw <strong>an elephant</strong>. <strong>The elephant</strong> was giving rides to tourists.
162231	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Ok. Now there was another one - <strong>the owner</strong>.
165862	Finn only mentioned the owner once, so why <strong>the</strong> [strong form] and not <strong>an</strong> [strong form]?
172310	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Good question, and the answer is: we use <strong>the</strong> before a person or thing when it's clear exactly which person or thing we're talking about, even if it's the first time.
184643	Let's hear it again:
186048	<strong>Finn</strong> <br><strong>The</strong> <strong>owner</strong> told me that her name was Sambo.
190223	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>So Finn's talking about the owner of Sambo, not the owner of any unknown elephant.
197219	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Ok, so that's <strong>a</strong>, <strong>an</strong> and <strong>the</strong>.
200812	Now let's hear more about elephants. Can you spot the articles in this sentence?
206153	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>African elephants are bigger than Indian elephants.
210854	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Actually there were no articles. Trick question, sorry!
215107	There's no article before African elephants and Indian elephants because we're talking about African elephants and Indian elephants in general.
224586	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>...not a specific African or Indian elephant.
228717	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>So in Finn's story, he didn't use an article when he talked about tourists in general.
234692	<strong>Finn</strong> <br><strong>The elephant</strong> was giving rides to <strong>tourists</strong>.
237992	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
244036	<strong>Emm<br></strong>And we're talking about articles.
246796	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>And now here are some top tips for using <strong>the.
250015	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Tip one. Don't use <strong>the</strong> before the names of <strong>most countries, cities </strong>and<strong> continents</strong>.
258450	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Just say: <strong>Saudi Arabia, Warsaw</strong> and <strong>Europe</strong>.
262057	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Tip two: say <strong>the</strong> with <strong>countries with plural names</strong> or the words <strong>Republic</strong> or <strong>Kingdom</strong> in the name.
269984	<strong>Rob</strong> <br><strong>The Maldives, The United Arab Emirates.
273477	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Tip three: use <strong>the</strong> for the names of <strong>rivers</strong>, <strong>seas</strong>, <strong>oceans</strong> and <strong>mountain ranges</strong>.
281115	<strong>Rob</strong> <br><strong>The Mississippi, The Red Sea, The Andes.
285137	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Tip four: Don't use <strong>the</strong> before names of <strong>single mountains</strong> and <strong>lakes</strong>.
291398	<strong>Rob</strong> <br><strong>Mount Kilimanjaro, Lake Titicaca.
294772	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>And now it's quiz time.
296533	I'm going to say a sentence with or without an article and you have to say if it's correct or wrong.
304243	Ready? Number 1: I've got cat.
308615	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>That's wrong. It should be <strong>I've got a cat</strong>.
311738	Because you need an article before a singular noun when you mention it the first time.
316405	Or you can say <strong>I've got the cat</strong> if it's clear which cat we're talking about.
321389	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Number 2. I'm going on holiday to United States next week. I'm so excited!
329428	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Wrong again. It should be I'm going to <strong>the United States</strong> next week because it's a plural country name.
337754	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>And number 3. I love elephants!
341485	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>And that's correct because you're talking about elephants in general, so: no article needed.
347837	<strong>Emma</strong> <br>Well done if you got those right.
349850	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>There's lots more information about articles on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.

359356	<strong>Both</strong> <br>Bye.
