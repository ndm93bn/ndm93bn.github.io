1	(Introduction...)
11848	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
15700	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And me, Callum. Hello.
17000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>In this programme weâ€™re looking at the phrase <strong>used to</strong> for talking about the past.
21750	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And weâ€™re also looking at the phrases <strong>be used to</strong> and <strong>get used to</strong>.
26486	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>be used to</strong> sound very similar, but the meaning and forms are different.
34414	So weâ€™ll explain the differences and give you lots of examples.
38529	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And weâ€™ll have a quiz to see how much youâ€™ve learnt, so letâ€™s get started. Now <strong>used to</strong> is always followed by the infinitive of the verb.
50431	It tells us that an action happened regularly in the past but it doesnâ€™t happen now. Hereâ€™s Rob with an example.
57700	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I <strong>used to eat </strong>meat, but now Iâ€™m a vegetarian.
60681	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And <strong>used to</strong> can also describe a past situation which is no longer true. Rob.
66400	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I <strong>used to be </strong>a bit overweight, but Iâ€™m much slimmer now.
70100	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Thatâ€™s straightforward. So what about<strong> be used to </strong>or<strong> get used to?</strong>
75065	Well, if you<strong> are used to </strong>something, it means that it isnâ€™t unusual or difficult for you because you have experienced it before. Rob.
83900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>When I first became a vegetarian, I missed eating meat, but now I<strong>â€™m used to </strong>it.
89000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So Robâ€™s familiar and comfortable with not eating meat now. He could also say:
94700	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I <strong>got used to</strong> it after a few weeks.
96915	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes, <strong>got</strong> is like <strong>became</strong>. He became familiar with it
101222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now in those examples, <strong>be used to </strong>and <strong>get used to </strong>are followed by the pronoun<strong> it.
108444	</strong>But we can also use the<strong> â€“ing form </strong>of a verb in the same position. Listen.
113806	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I<strong>â€™m not used to eating </strong>food without salt. I find it really tasteless.
118699	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Robâ€™s not familiar with food without salt.
121700	I know how he feels - but doctors are advising us all to <strong>get used to eating</strong> less salt.
127988	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I canâ€™t get used to eating no salt on my chips.
131828	<strong>Callum<br></strong>No, thatâ€™s just wrong. Itâ€™s wrong. So thereâ€™s <strong>used to</strong> with the infinitive and <strong>be </strong>or <strong>get used to</strong> with the <strong>-ing</strong> verb.
142898	Another difference is that <strong>used to</strong> is only for the past. There is no present or future form of <strong>used to</strong>.
150111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But we can use <strong>be</strong> or <strong>get used to</strong> in the present, past or future. Rob.
156000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>In the past, British people <strong>werenâ€™t used to eating</strong> pasta and pizza.
160222	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Thatâ€™s true. Pasta and pizza were new to Britain. But we all love them now donâ€™t we?
165111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, I think we<strong> got used to </strong>them pretty quickly! Even if we canâ€™t have slat on them.
169999	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>Youâ€™re listening to BBC Learning English.
175666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And weâ€™re looking at the phrases <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>be</strong> or <strong>get used to</strong>.
180605	And thereâ€™s another difference between them.
182907	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes, with<strong> used to, </strong>we form questions, short answers and negatives with<strong> did </strong>and<strong> didnâ€™t.</strong>
190047	And in questions and negatives,we lose the<strong> d </strong>on the end of<strong> used.</strong>
195727	You canâ€™t hear this because we donâ€™t pronounce the <strong>d</strong> on <strong>used</strong> anyway.
200811	But itâ€™s important in writing. Hereâ€™s an example.
203973	Catherine, <strong>d</strong><strong>id you use to have </strong>rice and curry when you were a child!
209028	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>No, I <strong>didnâ€™t</strong>. In fact <strong>we didnâ€™t use to have</strong> foreign food at all in our house.
214333	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Neither did. I think the most foreign food we had was a Cornish Pasty.
218622	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very British!
219666	<strong>Callum<br></strong>But with<strong> be used to </strong>and<strong> get used to, </strong>we form questions, short answers and negatives with the verb<strong> be.</strong>
229333	And we keep the<strong> d </strong>on the end of<strong> used. </strong>Catherine, <strong>are you used to buying </strong>international food now?
236555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, I am, most definitely. Thereâ€™s all sorts of foreign food here in London and Iâ€™ve tried most of it.
242400	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Just a couple more points. There are two alternative negative forms for <strong>used to</strong>.
249013	Instead of <strong>I didnâ€™t use to</strong>, we sometimes say <strong>I never used to</strong> or <strong>I used not to.</strong> Listen
257444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I never <strong>used to eat</strong> many vegetables. <strong>I used not to eat</strong> many vegetables.
261800	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Just remember that <strong>used not to</strong> sounds very formal, and is mainly used in writing nowadays.
268700	Now Catherine, are there any types of foreign food that you <strong>arenâ€™t used to?
272333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I tried Japanese food a few times, but<strong> I canâ€™t get used to it.
277014	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And there is the modal auxiliary <strong>canâ€™t</strong> with <strong>get used to</strong>.
281333	Itâ€™s a very useful piece of language. We can use it in the past as well. Rob?
285800	<strong>Rob</strong><br>I <strong>couldn't get used to</strong> living in the countryside, so I moved back to the city.
295222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now itâ€™s quiz time! Is this sentence correct or wrong?
303555	Iâ€™ve been in this job for three months so I used to it now.
308111	Iâ€™ve been in this job for three months so I used to it now.
314333	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Thatâ€™s not correct. Itâ€™s <strong>Iâ€™m used to it</strong>, with the verb <strong>be</strong>.
319574	Number two. <strong>D</strong><strong>id you use </strong>to living in London when you were a child? <strong>D</strong><strong>id you use </strong>to living in London when you were a child?
329921	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s wrong. The correct sentence is: Did you use to live in London?
335985	And number three. I donâ€™t really like Japanese food but I hope Iâ€™ll be used to it. I donâ€™t really like Japanese food but I hope Iâ€™ll be used to it.
349314	<strong>Callum <br></strong>Thatâ€™s not correct. It should be <strong>Iâ€™ll get used to it</strong>.
353444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It should! Well done at home if you got those right.

363111	<strong>All</strong> <br>Bye.
