1	(Introduction...)
11900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neilâ€¦
15970	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
20400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And today, weâ€™re talking about the third conditional.
24100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes - weâ€™ll be looking at why and when we use it.
27700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And weâ€™ll see how to form itâ€¦
29850	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thereâ€™ll be at a very helpful pronunciation tipâ€¦
32800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And thereâ€™ll also be a third conditional quiz at the end of the show!
38215	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, the main use of the third conditional is to talk about imaginary situations in the past.
45400	And hereâ€™s Mike with our first example:
49100	<strong>Mike<br></strong>I was really late for work today. When I got to the station, it turned out the trains were cancelled.
56137	<strong>If I had known the trains were cancelled, I would have taken a bus.
61134	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And Mikeâ€™s last sentence is describing an imaginary situation.
65310	In reality, Mike was late for work because he didnâ€™t know the trains were cancelled, and he didnâ€™t take a bus.
72994	He uses the third conditional to imagine a different past situation when he says: <strong>If I had known the trains were cancelled, I would have taken a bus.
85178	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Letâ€™s take a closer look. There are two parts to this sentence.
89700	One part is made with <strong>if </strong>plus <strong>past perfect</strong>:
94827	<strong>Mike<br></strong><strong>If I had known</strong> the trains were cancelled â€¦
97381	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the other part is made of <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>would have</strong> plus a <strong>past participle</strong>.
103602	<strong>Mike<br></strong>â€¦ <strong>I</strong> <strong>would have taken</strong> a bus.
105368	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we put the two parts together to talk about an imaginary situation in the past, and its imaginary result.
112700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You can change the order of the two parts if you like: the meaning stays the same:
117649	<strong>Mike<br></strong><strong>I would have taken</strong> a bus <strong>if I had known</strong> the trains were cancelled.
121867	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Letâ€™s have some more examples.
124200	Listen out for <strong>if</strong> plus <strong>past perfect</strong> with <strong>would </strong><strong>have</strong> plus a <strong>past participle</strong>.
130500	<strong>Mike<br></strong>I got two Ds and an F in my exams.
133995	<strong>If I had worked harder, I would have got better </strong><strong>grades.
138757	Patty was a great singer when she was younger.
142051	<strong>She would have won that TV talent show if she had entered it.
147210	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we can use negatives in either or both parts of the sentence.
152200	Here are a couple of examples, with the negative forms <strong>hadnâ€™t</strong> and <strong>wouldnâ€™t</strong>:
159000	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Abid met his wife at university. Theyâ€™ve been married for 3 years now.
164700	<strong>If Abid hadnâ€™t gone to university, he wouldnâ€™t have met his wife.
171000	I registered my mobile phone on a tracker website.
175000	When I lost it, I logged on to the site and they told me where it was.
179600	<strong>If I hadnâ€™t registered my phone, it would have been lost for ever.
184400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So you can see that the third conditional is very useful to talk about things weâ€™re pleased we did, as well as things we wish weâ€™d done differently.
193500	So what about you Neil â€“ anything youâ€™d change â€“ or not change â€“ in your past?
198200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I lived in Canada when I was a child and if I hadnâ€™t lived in Canada I wouldnâ€™t have got dual citizenship. Iâ€™m a citizen of the UK and Canada.
210404	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.
216117	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about third conditionals. And now itâ€™s time to talk about pronunciation.
222113	We use lots of short forms in third conditionals. And hereâ€™s Mike again with an example.
228800	<strong>Mike<br></strong>If <strong>Iâ€™d</strong> had my camera, <strong>Iâ€™d</strong> have taken a photo.
232900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So in the <strong>if</strong> part, <strong>I</strong> and <strong>had</strong> are shortened to <strong>Iâ€™d.
240600	</strong> In the main part, <strong>I </strong>and <strong>would</strong> are shortened to <strong>Iâ€™d</strong>, and we also drop the <strong>h</strong> from have.
249800	So <strong>I would have</strong> becomes <strong>â€˜Iâ€™dâ€™veâ€™. </strong>Letâ€™s hear another example:
258158	<strong>Mike<br></strong><strong>If Iâ€™d woken up earlier, I wouldnâ€™t have missed my flight.
263800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So <strong>I had</strong> become <strong>Iâ€™d</strong> in the if part and <strong>would not have</strong> becomes <strong>â€˜wouldnâ€™tâ€™veâ€™</strong> in the main part.
275700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now itâ€™s time for a quiz! Iâ€™m going to say two sentences, and you have to use them to make a third conditional sentence.
285633	Hereâ€™s the first one. Mike forgot Janeâ€™s birthday. She was upset.
291402	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>If Mike hadnâ€™t forgotten Janeâ€™s birthday, she wouldnâ€™t have been upset.
296800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Good. Another one: I ate too much. I feel sick.
301700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>If I hadnâ€™t eaten too much, I wouldnâ€™t have felt sick.
306004	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the last one: I didnâ€™t go to the party. I didnâ€™t meet Francesca.
311700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I wouldâ€™ve met Francesca if Iâ€™d gone to the party.
315416	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.
320156	And weâ€™ve just got time for a top tip before we finish.
324199	Remember, in standard English, thereâ€™s only one <strong>would</strong> in a third conditional sentence.
330700	We donâ€™t use <strong>would</strong> in the <strong>if</strong> part.
333400	Hereâ€™s an example of an incorrect sentence.
336900	<strong>Mike<br></strong>If Tom would have said sorry, Sonia would have forgiven him.
341700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hereâ€™s the correct version:
343800	<strong>Mike<br></strong><strong>If Tom had said sorry, Sonia would have forgiven him.
347680	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Great. So thatâ€™s the third conditional.
351300	Itâ€™s made of <strong>if</strong> plus the <strong>past perfect</strong> tense, and <strong>would</strong> <strong>have</strong> plus the past participle.
357100	We use it to talk about imaginary situations in the past.
360912	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thereâ€™s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
