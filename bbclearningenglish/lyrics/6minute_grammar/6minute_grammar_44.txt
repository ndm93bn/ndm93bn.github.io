1	(Introduction...)
10674	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello everyone and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
15434	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And me, Sophie.Hello.
19016	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Today we're talking about adverbs of frequency.
22945	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>That's right. Adverbs of frequency give us more information about a verb.
28162	They help us talk about how often we do something. We can use them to describe daily routines.
34794	Here's Neil with our first example:
37057	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>I always drink coffee in the morning.
40356	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thanks Neil. From most frequent to least frequent, you can use <strong>always</strong>, followed by <strong>usually</strong>, and then <strong>sometimes</strong>, then <strong>rarely</strong> for things that don't happen a lot and finally <strong>never</strong> for things you don't do.
60810	What do you do before you go to bed, Sophie?
64711	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, I always brush my teeth before I go to bed - and I sometimes have a decaff cup of tea!
72429	Let's have another example:
74272	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>I always take the bus to work.
77569	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>So we can use <strong>always</strong> for repeated actions - things you do every day.
83154	<strong>Finn</strong><em> <br></em>Now let's look at word order.
86072	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes - adverbs of frequency usually go between the subject and the main verb.
91930	Tell us about something you do every day, Finn!
94896	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, when I'm at work: I <strong>always have</strong> lunch with you!
101748	Now a question for you Sophie: What do you do after work?
107113	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I <strong>usually go</strong> to the gym after work - not every day - maybe three or four times a week.
114516	I <strong>often watch</strong> TV in the evenings and I <strong>sometimes read</strong> in bed.
119239	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, believe it or not, I <strong>rarely watch</strong> TV - maybe just once a week, and I <strong>never drink</strong> coffee in the evening: it keeps me awake!
132846	Now let's talk about auxiliary verbs with adverbs of frequency. Neil.
139022	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>I can never remember Michael's birthday.
143123	<strong>Finn<em><br></em></strong>So here we have the auxiliary verb <strong>can</strong>.
147248	<strong>Can</strong> shows ability and it goes between the subject <strong>I</strong>, and the adverb <strong>never</strong>.
154601	I can never remember Michael's birthday. Let's have another one:
159751	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>You should never look directly at the sun.
163386	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Good advice using the auxiliary <strong>should</strong>, again between the subject and the adverb: <em>You should never look directly at the sun.
172492	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Another useful auxiliary is <strong>might</strong> for possibility - like this:
178438	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>We might never see each other again.
184696	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we can use the auxiliary <strong>might</strong> if we aren't certain about something- and it goes before the adverb.
192851	We might never see each other again.
195817	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>The verb <strong>to be</strong> also goes before the adverb:
199932	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ali is always late for work.
203019	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. Ali is always late for work.
206639	<strong>Is</strong> goes before the adverb <strong>always</strong>.
210822	Let's have another example with <strong>to be </strong>please Neil:
214534	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>British weather is rarely good.
217939	<strong>Ident<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
223724	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now for a note about negative adverbs <strong>never</strong> and <strong>rarely</strong><em>.
229888	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes: Remember, you can't use negative adverbs in negative sentences.
235545	For example, you can't say <em>British weather isn't never good</em> because isn't and never are both negative.
244068	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. Instead, say <em>British weather is never good</em>, or perhaps <em>British weather is rarely good.
252601	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Now for a quiz. I'll give you an auxiliary and an adverb, and you have to make a sentence.
261604	Finn will give an example of a possible answer.
264923	First one: <strong>can</strong> and<strong> sometimes</strong>.
268745	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You could say: <em>I can sometimes catch the early bus if I wake up in time.
277476	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Right. Next: <strong>should</strong> and <strong>never</strong>.
281969	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ok. You should never drink coffee before you go to bed.
287382	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes, excellent advice. It can be difficult to sleep.
292214	Last one: <strong>to be</strong> and <strong>often</strong><em>.
295558	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ok, well <strong>often</strong> means <strong>nearly always</strong>, soâ€¦<em>You are often late for lunch!
304322	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I knowâ€¦ sorry, Finn!
306309	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I forgive you. Now for a pronunciation tip.
313571	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes. Some people say often like this: <strong>often</strong>.
317930	You can hear the 't' sound: <strong>often</strong>. Other people pronounce it with a silent 't'.
325372	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Like this: <strong>oftenâ€¦ often</strong>. Both ways are acceptable.
331892	So that's adverbs of frequency - <strong>always, usually, often </strong>or <strong>often, sometimes, rarely</strong> and <strong>never</strong>.
343163	They go before the main verb, after an auxiliary, and you can use them to talk about how regularly you do things.
351690	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.
353792	<strong>All<br></strong>Bye.
