1	(Introduction...)
11901	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil.
15768	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
21523	<strong>Neil<br></strong>In today's programme we're talking about things we <strong>used to</strong> do.
25870	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...in other words, things we did regularly in the past.
29255	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, we'll look at the phrase <strong>used to</strong> in positive and negative sentences, and in questions.
35025	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We'll bring you some spelling and pronunciation tips.
37828	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And we'll finish of course with a quiz.
41746	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, let's start with some example sentences from Rob. Hello Rob.
47000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello.
47537	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Listen carefully and answer this question: What activities did these people do regularly in the past?
54824	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Petra used to eat junk food, but now she eats salads and vegetables.
60521	I used to play computer games, but now I read a lot.
66312	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, Petra used to eat junk food and Rob used to play computer games.
72653	The words <strong>used to</strong> in front of an infinitive verb, like <strong>used to eat</strong> or <strong>used to play</strong> tell us that someone did an activity regularly, or several times, in the past.
83656	Now pronunciation-wise, we say <strong>used to</strong> with a short /ju/ sound, used to, not a long /ju:/ like in 'Can I use your phone please?'
95615	It's not use, it's use. Here they are together:
100023	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I used to use a desktop computer, but now I've got a tablet.
105433	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thanks Rob. And we can see from that example that we often use <strong>used to </strong>with a<strong> verb</strong> when the present situation is different to the past - so in the past Rob had a desktop, but now he's got a tablet.
119581	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, <strong>used to</strong> with an <strong>infinitive</strong> means the activity happened regularly, or repeatedly, in the past.
126358	It can also describe a past state or situation, for example: I <strong>used to</strong> <strong>live</strong> in Japan, but now I live in London.
135148	But to say you did something just once in the past, use the past simple.
139927	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, the sentence <strong>I used to go to the gym on Saturdays</strong> means: I went to the gym on many Saturdays in the past.
148899	But the sentence <strong>I went to the gym last Saturday</strong> describes one event in the past, it's the past simple.
156886	To talk about what happens now, use a present tense.
161677	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I used to go running every day, but now I go running once a week.
167218	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
173708	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about <strong>used to</strong>.
176391	Let's take a look at negatives. Rob.
179073	<strong>Rob<br></strong>My sisters <strong>didn't use to talk</strong> to each other much but now they speak every day.
184456	Esra <strong>didn't use to have </strong>short hair, but <strong>she had </strong>a hair cut last week.
189952	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thanks Rob.
191589	And the phrase <strong>didn't</strong> <strong>use to</strong> helps us talk about past states and activities that didn't happen in the past, but they do now.
200751	And for all persons, it's <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>didn't</strong> plus <strong>use to</strong> plus <strong>an infinitive</strong>: <strong>My sisters</strong> <strong>didn't use to talk;</strong> <strong>Esra didn't use to have short hair.
215542	And there's a spelling note here isn't there Neil?
218417	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes there is.
219448	In positive sentences, <strong>used</strong> is spelt <strong>u-s-e-d</strong>, but in negative sentences and questions, it's just <strong>use</strong>: <strong>u-s-e</strong>, without the <strong>d</strong> at the end.
234040	But when we're speaking, they sound almost exactly the same. Listen to this:
239122	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>I didn't use to get up</strong> early at the weekend.
242529	<strong>I used to stay</strong> in bed all morning.
245281	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thanks Rob. Now, let's take a look at questions.
249624	Neil, <strong>which school did you use to go to</strong>?
252662	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I used to go to the local school.
255031	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. So, for questions like <strong>which school did you use to go to</strong>, it's <strong>did</strong> plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>use to</strong> plus <strong>infinitive</strong>.
266222	And it's the same for <strong>yes/no</strong> questions. Neil, did you use to walk to school?
271448	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, I didn't. I used to get the bus.
273624	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, for questions: <strong>did</strong>, <strong>subject</strong>, <strong>use to</strong> and <strong>infinitive</strong>.
278664	And remember, used to is spelt <strong>u-s-e</strong>; no <strong>d</strong>.
283815	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, it's time for a quiz. Question 1.
292428	How do you spell <strong>used</strong> in this sentence?
295601	I didn't <strong>use to</strong> have a tablet.
298153	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It's <strong>u-s-e</strong> without <strong>d</strong> because it's a negative.
303896	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. Number 2. What's the missing word?
309478	I [BLANK] to use social media every day, but now I only use it once a week.
316624	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is <strong>used</strong> with a <strong>d</strong>.
320649	I used to use social media every day.
324170	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...is the correct answer. And number three.
327113	Is this sentence right or wrong? I used to go to the gym last Friday.
333178	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's wrong, because it's a past event that happened only once.
338605	You can say <strong>I went to the gym last Friday</strong>, or you can say <strong>I used to go to the gym every Friday</strong>.
346514	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that's the end of the quiz - and the end of the show.
