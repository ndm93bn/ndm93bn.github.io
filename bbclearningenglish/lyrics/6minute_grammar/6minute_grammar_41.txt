12002	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.
15616	<strong>Emma<br> </strong>And me, Emma. Hello.
18952	<strong>Rob<br></strong>In today's programme we're talking about the past simple and the past continuous tensesâ€¦
24350	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Yes, we'll look at when we use each tense.
27349	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We'll show you how to form the positive, negative and question forms of each oneâ€¦
32523	<strong>Emma<br> </strong>And as usual, we'll finish with a quiz.
35748	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And first, here's a quick reminder of the past simple. Hello Finn.
39629	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello Rob.
40478	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Could you give us an example please?
41784	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Last night I saw the film 'Titanic'.
46306	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Ooh Titanic, what a movie! Finn saw it last night.
50861	So, we use the past simple for completed actions in the past.
55764	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And we had the past simple of the verb <strong>see</strong>, which is the irregular form <strong>saw</strong>.
61597	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And as we know, you just have to learn the irregular verbs.
65568	<strong>Emma<br></strong>But the good news is that lots of verbs are regular, and to make them into the past simple, you just add <strong>e</strong> and <strong>d</strong> to the infinitive, like this:
78839	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hundreds of passengers <strong>jumped</strong> into the sea.
83400	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Jump</strong> - <strong>jumped</strong>. Simple.
87411	To make past simple negatives, we add <strong>didn't</strong> to the infinitive, like this:
93180	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Sandra Bullock didn't win an Oscar for Gravity.
97339	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now let's look at past simple questions. Emma, did you see the news last night?
103285	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Yes, I did.
104314	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, for the question, it's: <strong>did</strong> plus the <strong>subject</strong> plus the <strong>infinitive</strong>.
110018	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And the short answers are: <strong>Yes</strong> plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>did</strong>: <strong>Yes, I did</strong>.
116424	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Or: <strong>No</strong> plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>didn't</strong>: <strong>No, I didn't</strong>.
121853	<strong>Emma<br></strong>So that's the past simple for completed actions in the past.
126585	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now, to talk about past activities, we can use the past continuous. Here's an example:
133307	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I was watching a movie on TV.
136945	It was raining. We were feeling very bored.
141678	<strong>Emma<br> </strong>Now, we can use the past continuous to talk about an activity that was already happening when something else happened, like this:
152343	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Dad was cooking dinner when the police arrived.
156392	The children were watching TV when the officers came into the living room.
161900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Ooh the police! Very dramatic!
164798	Yes, think about one activity interrupting the other - the activity that was already happening is in the past continuous - <strong>Dad was cooking dinner</strong>.
175666	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And the activity that interrupted it is in the past simple: <strong>the police arrived.
181376	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So you can put the past simple and continuous together to talk about activities and actions that happened one on top of another.
190042	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Remember those examples everyone - I'm going to test you later!
193971	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. To make the past continuous, it's <strong>was</strong> or <strong>were</strong> plus an<strong> i-n-g verb.
200897	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Dad was cooking dinner. The children were watching TV.
206153	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now to make the negative past continuous, you just put <strong>wasn't</strong> or <strong>weren't</strong> in front of the -ing verb, like this:
215709	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>The baby wasn't sleeping. The children weren't playing games.
221661	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Wasn't sleeping</strong> and <strong>weren't playing.
224417	<strong>Wasn't</strong> and <strong>weren't</strong> are short forms of <strong>was not</strong> and <strong>were not.
230263	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Now for past continuous questions, it's <strong>was</strong> or <strong>were</strong>, with the <strong>subject</strong> plus an <strong>i-n-g verb</strong>.
239381	And I'm going to demonstrate this by testing you on the examples we had before.
244928	Rob, <strong>was Mum cooking dinner?
247732	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>No, she wasn't: Dad was cooking dinner.
250794	<strong>Emma<br></strong>That's correct: well done. <strong>Were the children playing games?
255298	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>No, they weren't.
257267	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Correct, well done again!
259638	<strong>Rob<br></strong>For past continuous short answers it's: <strong>Yes</strong> plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>was</strong>, or: <strong>No</strong> plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>wasn't</strong>.
269352	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English dot com.
276016	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Right, time for a quiz.
278421	I'm going to say a sentence and you have to choose the right verb form to go in the gap.
285089	Ready? OK. Number 1. <br>When the phone rang, we ____ a film.
293118	Is it a) watched or b) were watching?
298505	When the phone rang, we ____ a film.
304660	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's b) When the phone rang, we were watching a film.
308867	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Good, number 2: Cate Blanchett _____ an Oscar for Best Actress.
316322	Is it a) was winning or b) won?
321778	Cate Blanchett _____ an Oscar for Best Actress.
327589	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's b) Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for Best Actress.
332526	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And here's the final question. Ready?
336512	When the police _____, Dad was cooking dinner.
341701	Is it a) arrived b) were arriving?
