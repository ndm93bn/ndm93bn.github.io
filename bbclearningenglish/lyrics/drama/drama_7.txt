1	(Introduction...)
27222	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Hello again. It's day 45. <strong>Passepartout and I were sleeping like babies when we suddenly heard </strong>a loud creaking and cracking sound.
37706	What could it be? We're in the middle of the Indian Ocean so we can't have hit any rocks.
44900	Sophia is up on deck steering the yacht â€“ I need to find out what's going on.
62000	<strong>PP<br></strong>Errâ€¦ what's all that noise? <strong>I was having a wonderful dream â€“ I was saving</strong> the Titanic from hitting an icebergâ€¦
70400	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Passepartout, something's happened.
73222	<strong>PP<br></strong>What? Err, where's this water coming from?
76700	<strong>Phil<br></strong>I'm going up to the deckâ€¦ Sophia, Sophia, what was that noise?
83800	Sophia?Where's Sophia?! She's not here!
88921	<strong>PP<br></strong>Out of the way, let me have a lookâ€¦ No, she's definitely goneâ€¦ but hold on, look, we've been swept onto a beach.
97400	<strong>Phil<br></strong>We're shipwrecked!
102143	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>We've landed on a huge, yellow, sandy beach.
106848	And beyond the beach there's a line of palm trees â€“ with coconuts growing on them.
113804	It looks like some kind of tropical island.
117500	Our satnav says we are at 11 degrees south, 100 degrees east - but according to the map there shouldnâ€™t be any land at this location.
128600	Why are we here, and where is Sophia?
138000	<strong>PP<br></strong>Phil look, there's a hole in the yacht â€“ that's why the water's coming in.
143700	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Oh no â€“ what are we going to do? We're castaways, stuck here forever.
149679	<strong>PP<br></strong>Of course we're not. Just go and collect some palm leaves and a few bits of driftwood.
155100	<strong>Luckily I learnt some yacht repair skills from a TV programme I watched.</strong> I should be able to patch her up.
162628	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Aye-aye captain. We need to get back to sea as soon as possible to look for Sophia.
170570	<strong>PP<br></strong>Hmm, I don't think we'll see her again. The ocean is huge: it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
178600	<strong>Phil<br></strong>But, we must try.
182500	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>We can't give up on Sophia now. I've collected all the bits that Passepartout needs for the repairs.
188700	I've made a small fire so I can boil some water and make some much-needed tea.
194600	<strong>Whilst I was beachcombing I found a beautiful shell.
200079	According to my encyclopaedia, it is a rare type of conch shell.
205479	That's lucky â€“ it is one of the things I need to collect as part of my challenge.
210083	Hmm, that's one bit of good news in a sea of bad news.
215400	Right, I just need to take a few photos before we go to put on my travel blogâ€¦</em>
224900	<strong>PP<br></strong>OK, the yacht is fixed, well sort of â€“ give me a hand to scoop out the water that got inside.
235200	We'll need to head for somewhere where we can get some proper repairs done.
239400	But I think we can be on our way. You just need to help me push her out to sea. Here goesâ€¦
245606	<strong>PP<br></strong>â€¦.Jump on Phil. I'll get the sails up and we'll be on our way.
256500	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Hey look Passepartout â€“ we've picked up a stowaway. A parrot!
261704	<strong>PP<br></strong>Hmm, wonderful, now I've got someone I can have a proper conversation with!
267237	<strong>Phil<br></strong>I think we should keep it â€“ it might bring us some good luck.
271700	<strong>PP<br></strong>If you say so. Now look, according to our map, I think we'll miss Indonesia and head for Papua New Guinea.
280100	With a good tail-wind we should be thereâ€¦ mmmâ€¦ tomorrow â€“ yes?
285000	<strong>Phil<br></strong>No Passepartout! We need to sail around here first to search for Sophia.
290200	She can't be far away â€“ maybe <strong>she fell off when we hit the beach</strong>?
295200	Hey, I think it's seen something. Quick - where are the binoculars? There! I can see something.
308205	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Sure enough â€“ the parrot has seen something. We've got closer and yes!
315100	It is Sophia â€“ she's floating on some kind of shipping container.
320000	I thought she was gone forever, but she's back â€“ and I'm so happy.
330500	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Phil, Passepartout, over here. Throw me a rope.
337500	Oh I'm so pleased to see you again. Oh I'm so hungry and thirsty.
344700	I'm so sorry. <strong>I fell asleep and a big wave threw me overboard.
351000	<strong>I tried</strong> to call outâ€¦ but <strong>you didnâ€™t hear me.
355171	I saw that old container and swam towards it.
359100	I was drifting about on it</strong> â€“ I thought I would never see you again â€“ I thought I was going to die â€“ but Phil, <strong>you saved me</strong>.
370500	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Wellâ€¦ I did, didn't I? But <strong>Passepartout helped me</strong> too, I think. <strong>He fixed the boat</strong>.
379997	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Oh yes, well done â€“ and who is your new friend?
385316	<strong>PP<br></strong>Just some parrot. <strong>It decided</strong> to perch on our yacht.
389500	It hasn't got a name yet but I suppose it can join us for this trip.
393160	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Ah, he's cuteâ€¦ I'll try and think of a name.
397382	In the meantime, how about some of that wonderful tea Phil?
401978	Come on Passepartout, we've no time to waste, we've got to get moving if we're going to win this race.
408000	<strong>PP<br></strong>Yes, yes, I know that.
412308	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>The team is back together. I'm so pleased <strong>we found Sophia</strong> â€“ although I'm not so sure Passepartout is.
422600	We <strong>were making very good progress until we got shipwrecked.
426800	That cost us a lot of time</strong> and now, only hard work and good luck will get us back to London in 80 days.
434702	Our next stop is Papua New Guinea, where we can finish repairing The Mermaid.
442800	But how long will that take? Time is running out.
