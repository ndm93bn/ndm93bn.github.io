1	(Introduction...)
29800	<strong>All<br></strong>Wooah! Watch out!
32800	<strong>Phil<br></strong>That was close.
37800	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Day 35 - we've just missed being hit by a huge container ship. We're all so tired and we didn't see it coming.
47800	We've been at sea for several days and without our satellite navigation system it's hard to know which way we're going.
55700	Passepartout needs medical help and <strong>we have to get</strong> more food supplies. <strong>We must find</strong> land soon.
68220	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Land ahoy!
70250	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Land? Really? At last! Come on.
73800	Let's head for the harbour and find a hospital quickly.
76800	<strong>Passepartout<br></strong>Oh, my head.
81800	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>We're on dry land. It's such a great feeling after just looking at endless water day after day.
91700	But where are we? People are speaking French and there's a wonderful smell of fresh coffee in the air.
100900	Anyway, we mustn't waste any more time. Sophia is taking Passepartout to a hospital to see a doctor about the cut on his head.
112298	<strong>I have to get</strong> our satnav fixed and purchase some more supplies for the next leg of our journey.
120700	And <strong>I must take</strong> some photographs too to put on my travel blog.
128400	But wait a minute, I don't know where I am! Time for a walk I think.
138300	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Excuse me young man - that coffee smells wonderful.
143600	<strong>Man<br></strong>Oh this is <em>Bourbon Pointu</em> coffee. It's the best in the world and you can only get it here.
150000	<strong>Phil<br></strong>And where is here?
153300	<strong>Man<br></strong>Reunion Island.
155200	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Reunion Island! So that's where we are. Goodness, we really have gone off course!
162200	<strong>Man<br></strong>Where are you heading?
163837	<strong>Phil<br></strong>We're supposed to be sailing around the world - but we got lost when our satnav broke.
170100	<strong>Man<br></strong>Oh <strong>you don't have to worry</strong> about that, my brother fixes gadgets. I'm sure he can help.
176800	Let me take it for you and if you come back at 4 o'clock it will be ready. Hopefully!
183600	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Brilliant. And while I'm here can I buy some of those beans?
189700	<strong>Man<br></strong>Sure. Here, take some coffee beans as a present from me to you - and remember your visit to Reunion.
198684	<strong>Phil</strong><br><strong><em>I</em></strong><em> <strong>had to bring</strong> home some unique and special coffee beans as part of the challenge, so this is gift is perfect.
208100	But we have a long way to go; <strong>we mustn't waste</strong> any more time. <strong>I must get on</strong> with the shopping, wait for our satnav to be fixed and hope that Passepartout will be ok.
223900	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Phil, Phil...we're back. Passepartout has got some stitches in his head. But I think he'll be fine.
231100	<strong>Passepartout<br></strong>Oh will I? You're the expert now?
235000	Maybe if you leave me to sail our yacht we won't have any more little accidents?
240600	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Come on Passepartout, let's all try to get on shall we?
245000	I know how useful you are - but Sophia got us safely through to Reunion.
251900	Come along - let's all be friends. OK?
255600	<strong>Passepartout<br></strong>OK then. How's the satnav?
259600	<strong>Phil<br></strong>It's fixed and it didn't cost much. Look, if I switch it on.
265730	I can tell you exactly where we are: 21 degrees south, 55 degrees east.
274850	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Impressive!
276500	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Yes, and look, I've got some special coffee to take home. Bourbon Pointu.
283700	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Another one of your 'souvenirs'! Come on, <strong>we must get going</strong> - the weather forecast says there's a big storm coming and <strong>we have to avoid</strong> it.
292200	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Yes, good idea. We can't waste any more time. Let's get back to the harbour.
298000	Passepartout, could you carry these bags of food please...they're...quite heavy.
315000	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Isn't this where we left the yacht - between these two other boats?
320600	<strong>Passepartout<br></strong>Are you sure Sophia? We did arrive in a rush.
324300	<strong>Phil<br></strong>No, it was definitely here. In fact - look - these are our ropes. They've been cut.
332603	I don't believe it but I think our yacht has been stolen.
339000	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Stolen! It couldn't get any worse. We're stuck halfway around the world with no yacht.
350200	There is no way we can get round the world in 80 days now. We've got to find our yacht - but where is it?
