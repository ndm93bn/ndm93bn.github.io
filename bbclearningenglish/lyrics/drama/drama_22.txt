1	(Introduction...)
13940	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Algernon has just asked his good friend Jack to explain why he calls himself Jack in the country but Ernest in London.
25100	Jack says it's because he is the <strong>guardian</strong> of a girl called Cecily, who lives with him in the country.
32122	She looks up to him and he feels he should behave well when he's with her, so he pretends he has a younger brother called Ernest so that when he comes up to London, he can enjoy himself.
48646	<strong>Jack<br></strong>That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth.
52933	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>So, Ernest, you are a <strong>Bunburyist</strong>!
56555	<strong>Jack<br></strong>What on earth do you mean?
58215	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, so that you can come to London as often as you like.
65555	I have invented a sick friend called Bunbury so that I can go to the country whenever I like. Bunbury is <strong>invaluable</strong>.
74479	For example, if Bunbury didn't have such bad health, I would have to have dinner with my aunt Lady Bracknell tonight. And I have no intention of doing that.
84999	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Why not?
86300	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>Well, to begin with, I had dinner with her on Monday - once a week is quite enough to eat with your own relations.
92977	Secondly, I know <strong>I will be seated </strong>next to Mary Farquhar, who always <strong>flirts</strong> with her own husband - most unpleasant!
100017	Besides, I want to have dinner with you and talk about Bunburyism.
103999	<strong>Jack<br></strong>I'm not a. Bunburyist. In fact I think I am going to kill my brother Ernest.
110946	Cecily is a little too interested in him. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr... with your sick friend.
119777	<strong>Algernon<br></strong><strong>I will not be separated</strong> from Bunbury.
122202	<em>(a bell rings)</em> Ah! That must be my aunt now.
126744	Now, if I keep her busy for ten minutes so you can <strong>propose </strong>to Gwendolen, will you have dinner with me tonight?
133777	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Alright Algy.
143333	<strong>Lane<br></strong>Lady Augusta Bracknell and Miss Gwendolen Fairfax.
149074	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>A well-dressed, elderly woman and her daughter, a pretty, young lady enter the room.
158111	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>Good afternoon, dear Algernon. Oh, hello, Mr Worthing.
162700	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Hello, Lady.
163833	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>Now, Algernon. I'd like a nice cup of tea, and one of those cucumber sandwiches you promised me.
168300	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>Certainly, Aunt Augusta. Good heavens! Lane! Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?
176300	<strong>Lane<br></strong>There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.
179888	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>No cucumbers!
181111	<strong>Lane<br></strong>No, sir.
182084	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>I am very sorry, Aunt Augusta.
184333	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>It doesn't matter, Algernon. Pour me some tea.
187055	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>Here you are.
188777	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>Thank you. Now, Algernon, about tonight - <strong>you</strong> <strong>will be seated</strong> next to Mary Farquhar.
195100	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>I'm afraid, Aunt Augusta, I won't be able to have dinner with you tonight.
199444	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>But why not, Algernon?
201111	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>Well, I have just heard that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again. I'll have to go and see him.
207888	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>It's very strange. This Mr Bunbury seems to have curiously bad health.
214111	I think it is time that he made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.
218777	And I would be very grateful if you could ask Mr Bunbury to please not be ill on Saturday, because I need you to organise my music at my <strong>soirĂ©e</strong>.
227700	<strong>Algernon<br></strong>I'll speak to him, Aunt Augusta, and I'm sure he'll be well by Saturday.
232333	But why don't we go next door to look at the programme of music I've prepared.
236150	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>Thank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you.
243000	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Algernon and his aunt go into the music room, leaving Jack and Gwendolen alone.
252313	<strong>Jack<br></strong>It has been a lovely day, Miss Fairfax.
255216	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>Please don't talk to me about the weather, Mr Worthing.
258262	Whenever people talk about the weather, I am sure they mean something else. And that makes me nervous.
263932	<strong>Jack<br></strong>I do mean something else.
266777	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>I thought so.
268068	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you.
273555	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>Yes, I realised that. Actually, I<strong> have always been fascinated </strong>by you...even before we met.
281970	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Really?
283279	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>Yes, I've always wanted to love someone called Ernest. That name <strong>inspires</strong> complete confidence.
291555	When Algernon first mentioned that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was<strong> destined </strong>to love you.
298222	<strong>Jack<br></strong>You really love me, Gwendolen?
300166	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong><strong>Passionately</strong>!
301444	<strong>Jack<br></strong>But you don't really mean that you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?
306222	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>But your name <em>is</em> Ernest.
308833	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Yes, I know. But what if it was something else?
313107	Do you mean you couldn't love me then? Personally, I don't think the name suits me.
319111	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>It suits you perfectly.
320969	<strong>Jack<br></strong>But there are lots of other much nicer names. Jack, for instance, is a charming name.
327444	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>Jack? Oh, no, Jack does not have the same sound at all.
332149	It's not exciting. The only really safe name is Ernest.
337333	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Gwendolen, <strong>I must get christened </strong>at once - I mean, we must get married at once.
342404	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>Married, Mr Worthing?
344049	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Well...surely. You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you felt the same.
351900	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>I adore you. But you haven't proposed to me yet.
355700	<strong>Nothing has been said</strong> at all about marriage.
358555	<strong>Jack<br></strong>Well...may I propose to you now?
366698	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>And so Jack <strong>kneels</strong> down and asks Gwendolen to marry him.
372888	She accepts and Jack is still on his knees when Lady Bracknell returns.
382362	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>Mr Worthing! Do get up!
385887	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>Mamma! Please leave us. Mr Worthing has not quite finished yet.
391555	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>Finished what, may I ask?
393800	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong><strong>I am engaged</strong> to Mr Worthing, mamma.
396888	<strong>Lady Bracknell<br></strong>Pardon me, you are not engaged to anyone.
399683	When you do become engaged, I, or your father will tell you.
404112	<strong>A young girl should be surprised</strong> by an engagement, pleasantly or unpleasantly.
409900	It is not something that <strong>she is allowed</strong> to arrange for herself.
413222	And now I would like to ask you a few questions, Mr Worthing.
416700	Gwendolen, can you wait for me below in the carriage.
419555	<strong>Gwendolen<br></strong>Mamma!
