27860	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Day 38 - Disaster! Our yacht has been stolen.
33460	We were on Reunion Island when someone<strong> cut</strong> the ropes and <strong>took</strong> it.
40147	Where is it - and how are we going to find it? Does this mean we're going to lose the race?
52600	<strong>PP<br></strong>Well that's it then. We might as well give up and go home.
56700	<strong>Phil<br></strong>We can't stop now - we're having so much fun.
61000	And anyway, we can't go home without our yacht.
64600	Oh look, there's that man who gave me the coffee beans. Maybe he can help.
70200	<strong>Man<br></strong>Hello, how's the satnav now? All working?
74900	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Well, err, yes - it's working, thank you very much.
79900	But we have another slight, little problem. We haven't got a yacht to put it on anymore.
86252	<strong>Man<br></strong>Really?
87400	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Yes, I'm afraid so. It looks like it's been <strong>stolen</strong>.
92800	you know,<strong> pinched</strong>.<strong>nicked.
96300	<strong>Man<br></strong>Surely not. This sort of thing doesn't happen around here. It must be... pirates!
103900	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Pirates! Real-life pirates?
107300	<strong>Man<br></strong>Yes, they do exist but they're not like the pirates in stories.
112900	They will steal almost anything and they are very, very dangerous.
118445	But we must get your boat back so let's hope these pirates aren't too bad.
124849	Come on, let's use my fishing boat and go looking for your missing yacht. They can't be very far away.
136091	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>The man who <strong>gave</strong> me the coffee beans is taking us out to sea in his fishing boat.
142734	But how are we going to find our yacht?
145937	Pirates are lawless and will do anything to protect their bounty - but why does it have to be our yacht?
155800	Oh, it could be anywhere now. But hold on.
162040	what is it? I think Passepartout has seen something.
172300	<strong>PP<br></strong>Over there, look! That's our yacht.
175884	and I think I can see one... two people on board.
180100	Let's hope they haven't sabotaged our yacht.
183000	<strong>Phil<br></strong>What are we going to do? We don't want to get too close - they might have guns.
189900	<strong>Man<br></strong>OK, we need to slow down and approach carefully.
194236	Let me just look through my binoculars to see if they have guns... hold on! They look familiar.
202600	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Do you know them?
204408	<strong>Man<br></strong>Errr...yes! I do.
207043	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Are they dangerous?
208964	<strong>Man<br></strong>Absolutely not. They are not fearsome pirates: I used to play with them in the island football team.
218200	They <strong>didn't score</strong> any goals then and they're not going to sabotage your journey now.
225400	Come on, let's get your boat back.
228600	<strong>PP<br></strong>It's a yacht!
233400	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>We've caught up with our yacht - The Mermaid - and the would-be pirates have given it back to us, and we <strong>got </strong>an apology.
243400	These guys <strong>were</strong> 'joyriders' - they <strong>stole</strong> our boat just for a bit of fun - luckily they <strong>didn't cause</strong> much damage but they've almost ruined our chances of getting back to London on time.
260000	<strong>Man<br></strong>So sorry again about these guys.
262884	I will make sure they pay for what they <strong>did</strong>.
266000	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Farewell and thanks for your help.
271100	<strong>PP<br></strong>Well, that <strong>was</strong> a real adventure - now can we get back on course and try and make up for lost time?
277700	We have a long way to go.
279700	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Passepartout, don't forget it <strong>was</strong> you who <strong>hit</strong> his head and <strong>had </strong>to go to hospital remember?
285357	<strong>PP<br></strong>Err, well, I think it was you who<strong> sailed</strong> us 500 miles in the wrong direction.
290966	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Will you two just stop it - we all need to get on and try and work out how we're going to win this challenge and get back to London on time.
302603	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Don't worry Phil, it's easy - if we head south we'll pick up some trade winds - that will make us much faster.
310200	We'll get to Indonesia in just a few days.
312800	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Sounds like a plan. Passepartout?
315962	<strong>PP<br></strong>Fine by me. But we've got a long, long way to go - I think we'll need to take turns in sailing while the other two get some sleep.
323892	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Good idea. I'll steer first and get us back on course.
327500	You guys get some sleep - it's been a long and busy day.
331300	First Phil, perhaps you can make some of that delicious tea you're good at making, hmm?
336670	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Aye-aye captain! I've always <strong>wanted</strong> to say that. Right away Sophia.
347000	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Making tea! It seems to be the only thing I'm good at doing on this yacht.
355000	Ah well, if it keeps the crew happy! Well, we're out in the middle of the Indian Ocean now and we have the wind in our sails.
365300	Sophia is on deck and Passepartout is here asleep - you can probably hear him snoring!
373700	Actually, I'm feeling...quite sleepy. now.
377838	The rolling of the yacht on the waves seems to be rocking me to sleep. like a baby.
387700	Maybe I... should get some sleep before.
395600	I have to steer...the yacht.
411100	<strong>PP<br></strong>What? Huh? What was that?
415400	<strong>Phil<br></strong>I think we've hit something - but what?
