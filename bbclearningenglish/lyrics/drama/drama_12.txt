1	(Introduction...)
14777	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>I have arrived at Jamaica Inn to live with my aunt.
18777	My uncle is landlord here. It's a cold and lonely place.
27921	I'm at the door and I'm waiting for someone to let me in.
34057	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Who's there?
36666	<strong>Mary<br></strong>It's me. Mary. Mary Yellan. [Heavy door opening]
46058	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Ah, so, you've arrived at last. Well, say hello to your Uncle Joss.
55888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Where is my Aunt Patience?
57822	<strong>Joss<br></strong>What's the hurry? Don't you want to give me a big kiss first?
63777	Patience! She's here.
67437	[impatiently] Where are you, woman? Patience! Where in hell is that woman?
74444	<strong>Patience<br></strong>I'm here. Is it the girl?
77888	<strong>Joss<br></strong>See for yourself.
83666	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>A woman with grey hair hurries towards me.
87978	In the candlelight her face is pale. She looks afraid.
96000	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Mary.
98222	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Aunt Patience - I am so glad to see you.
103222	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>But she is unrecognisable. Her curls have gone and her happy smile also.
112666	I can see that <strong>she's been crying</strong>. This woman is old and anxious. She starts to cry.
125555	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Stop <strong>whimpering</strong>, woman. Can't you see the girl is hungry!
130222	I'll take her things up to her room. If there's nothing to eat on the table when I come down, you'll soon have something to cry about.
138999	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>He lifts my heavy box as if it's a bag of feathers.
142999	He is huge with shoulders like those of a bear.
148555	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>The kitchen is full of smoke from the fire.
152800	There are <strong>stains</strong> on the stone floor and there's a strong smell of alcohol.
160000	On the table there are two empty bottles of <strong>brandy</strong>.
166333	<strong>Patience<br></strong>You mustn't mind your Uncle Joss.
168536	Some people find him strange at first, but he is very <strong>respected</strong> here.
173800	Just yesterday he told me that a man stopped and told him how much he admired.
178266	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Are you talking rubbish again woman?
180497	Sit down Mary. Eat. Listen, Mary. I'm in charge here and you'll do as I say.
188669	You'll serve the customers in the bar and help in the house.
191888	But if you open your mouth and <strong>squawk</strong> like a hen, you'll be sorry.
196772	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I'll help you like you say, but if you hurt my aunt, I'll tell and you'll be <strong>punished</strong>.
206242	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Patience, go and get me another bottle and be quick.
216000	Big words - maybe we're not so different, Mary.
220575	Here, drink this. This is my <strong>curse</strong>, Mary - drink.
226777	<strong>I've been drinking a little today but</strong> - Oh you'll see how we drink here some Saturdays - they hear the shouting and singing far away.
237000	People are afraid of me but I'm afraid of no one. Go to bed now.
244444	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>He suddenly grabs my wrist.
247257	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Listen carefully. Some nights you'll hear wheels, footsteps and voices outside.
254564	You must stay in your room and put your blanket over your ears.
258333	If you ask questions, I'll break every bone in your body. Do you understand?
269222	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>My room is small and <strong>bare.</strong>Just a bed and a table with a broken mirror.
280222	I feel lonely and <strong>trapped </strong>like a bird in a cage.
286000	But it's not too late to run away. I <strong>creep</strong> down the dark passage.
300777	<strong>Mary<br></strong>[to herself] Who's crying? It must be my aunt!
306333	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I turn back. My uncle frightens me but I must stay and protect Aunt Patience.
319798	I did not sleep well last night. My bed is hard and the blanket is thin.
329555	The house is quiet this morning. I'll look for a place to wash downstairs.
338573	Here is the bar. Ah, there's a passage here - maybe it's along here. A door - this must be the washroom.
350800	<strong>Mary<br></strong>How strange - it's locked.
355200	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Mary! What are you doing?
358700	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Why is this room locked, Aunt Patience? What's in it?
362777	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>My aunt looks quickly behind her and her eyes are like a frightened rabbit's.
368630	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Is it because of the people who come to the inn at night?
372100	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Mary. Mary. <strong> I've been worrying about how to tell you this</strong>.
377760	I must warn you. Bad things happen here. Men come at night and they go into that room with Joss.
385712	When you hear them, you must stay in your room. You must never ask me or your uncle about it again.
394089	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>What is in this room and why is my Aunt so scared?
401444	I'm not going to like it here but I must stay to support her and keep her safe.
410222	Next time we meet - I have to work in the bar of Jamaica Inn on Saturday night where I get to meet a group of rough and drunk men.
421444	Later that night there are some strange goings-on in the yard outside. What's going on at Jamaica Inn?
