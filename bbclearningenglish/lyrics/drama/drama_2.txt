1	(Introduction...)
24100	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Hello again. It's Phil here.
27900	You may know that I've been set a challenge to sail around the world in 80 days - it's an impossible challenge especially as I have never sailed a yacht before.
40200	But I said 'yes' - so here it goes.
48700	<strong>Tom <br></strong>So, here we at Saint Catherine's Dock and look - here's my yacht <em>- The Mermaid</em> - I know she's a bit scruffy but I'm sure she'll get you round the world.
59000	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Hmm, on my own! That's the bit that worries me. It's a very small boat.
66700	<strong>Tom <br></strong>It's a yacht - not a boat - look: it's got a sail!
71000	Anyway, you'll be fine. Just call me on the satellite phone if you have any problems.
76600	<strong>PP <br></strong>Hello, hi. Phil. Phil! It's me.
81200	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Pete, what are you doing here?
86300	<strong>Phil <em> </em><br></strong><em>Pete is my office assistant: He makes the tea, he does the photocopying, he sometimes gives me ideas for my books.
95400	He's a great guy - so I'm really pleased to see him now.
103600	<strong>PP <br></strong>Tom posted a message on Facebook that you're going on a trip round the world, or something.
110300	I couldn't believe my eyes - so I had to come here and see for myself. Look, I've brought you some books to read...and a map - you'll find that useful.
119444	<strong>Phil <br></strong>I will...but what I really need is a travelling companion.
127200	someone who can help me on my journey...someone like you?! How about it?
134950	<strong>PP <br></strong>No. Absolutely not. I can't.
138760	I've got to. errr. feed the cat.
142367	<strong>Tom <br></strong>I'll feed your cat. Go on. Can't you see he needs your help!
147400	<strong>PP </strong><br>I get<strong> seasick</strong>.
149680	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Rubbish! I remember when you went sailing with your Dad - you were always fine.
156525	<strong>PP</strong> <br>That was different. We were sailing on a lake.
160300	<strong>Phil</strong> <br>Well, you know about sails and rope and anchors - you'd be great.
168800	Besides, if you come with me you can have a share of the money.
173700	<strong>Tom <br></strong>If you get home in 80 days!
178100	<strong>Phil <em> </em><br></strong><em>I'm pleased to report that Pete is joining me.
181340	I'm so pleased I have someone to 'show me the ropes', as it were - in other words, show me what to do.
189800	He's a good friend, a loyal assistant and he goes everywhere with me so I'm giving him the nickname 'Passepartout', just like in the original book, Around the World in Eighty Days - I hope he likes it!
214900	<strong>Phil <br></strong><em>We've set sail. Our adventure has begun. Let me describe the yacht to you. It is 12 metres long.
224800	It has a huge mast, with the mainsail attached. There is an engine as well just in case there's no wind.
232600	The wooden deck has seating at the<strong> stern </strong>- that's the back.
238800	There are some steps down to the galley - that's the kitchen - and there are two <strong>berths</strong> or beds for us to sleep in.
249444	I can't believe we're going to live in this tiny space for 80 days!
260200	<strong>PP <br></strong>Phil, we've got the wind in our sails, we're making good progress. I can't even see land any more.
267700	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Yes. Thanks to you, it's <strong>plain sailing</strong>! So, what does this rope do?
277700	<strong>PP </strong><br>It moves the<strong> jib</strong> - the sail at the front.
281900	<strong>Phil <br></strong>And this one?
284600	<strong>PP </strong><br>That moves the boom from side to side. No, no. But don't pull it until.
290100	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Ouch! That hurt.
298000	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Day 5 and I'm learning how to sail but my best skills are in the galley, making tea.
304900	The weather is good but we seem to have a problem with the yacht.
315400	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Passepartout, is it me or is it getting a bit wet down in the <strong>galley</strong>?
322949	<strong>PP <br></strong>Let me have a look. Oh dear! There's water all over the floor. I think the boat is leaking.
333300	<strong>Phil <br></strong>What? What are we going to do?
336396	<strong>PP <br></strong>Drown!
338100	<strong>Phil <br></strong>What? Really? I'm going to get on the radio and call for help.
344700	Mayday! Mayday! Oh no. The radio isn't working. We're in big trouble!
350500	<strong>PP <br></strong>Be quiet. Calm down Phil. The radio isn't turned on - and we don't need to abandon ship just yet.
358172	I need to know where this water is coming from. It's only a slow leak but I think we need to fix it quickly. We need to head for dry land.
372900	<strong>Phil <br></strong><em>According to the map the nearest land is some islands at 16 degrees north, 24 degrees west.
381200	Do you know where that is? Let's hope we get there before we sink.
