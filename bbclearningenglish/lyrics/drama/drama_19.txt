1	(Introduction...)
8111	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I'm at the Vicar's house.
11700	I'm here because last night, when I returned to the inn, I found my uncle - dead.
21899	lying on the floor with a knife in his back.
27600	When Mr Bassat arrived with his men, they found my aunt's body upstairs...she'd also been <strong>stabbed</strong>.
38000	The vicar suggested I stay with him.
40999	He came to the inn as soon as he read my note.
44800	He's not here. He left before I woke up.
49868	While I've been waiting for him, I've been thinking about who the killer could be.
58666	Mr Bassat asked me if I had an idea who it was.
62666	I told him I didn't...but that's not true.
69222	I remember how Jem told me that he hated his brother.
74199	so they'll catch and hang him...or else he'll ride away, laughing at me.
84800	Either way, I know that I love him.
95666	Strange how this room is so empty. No books, no paintings.
103333	Not like the vicar's house in Helford where I lived with my mother.
107777	His living room had pictures of smiling angels and village scenes.
112870	and piles of books on the desk. There's nothing on this desk.
120777	I know. I'll write and ask if I can stay with him.
126777	Now, where's a pen and paper? Ah. in this drawer perhaps.
138000	That's <strong>odd! </strong>Nothing in the drawer, wait, there <em>is</em> a piece of paper.
145000	oh but it's already got something on it... a picture - by the vicar Â­Â­- his initials are there.
153777	What a strange picture. It makes me <strong>shiver</strong>.
160888	It's the village church with the vicar and his <strong>congregation</strong>.
166888	but all the people have got sheep's heads and look stupid.
171725	The vicar has drawn himself as a wolf but not an ordinary wolf, a laughing wolf.
180700	What does it mean.? Oh no! He's back...quick!
187066	I shut the drawer quickly and sit by the fire. I'm shaking.
194570	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh, Vicar.
196333	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Did I <strong>startle</strong> you? I'm sorry I was so long.
200127	My horse was <strong>lame</strong>. You must be hungry?
204333	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I find it difficult to speak. The picture has shocked me.
209135	The vicar asks me to get the food from the kitchen.
212377	When I return, there are papers all over the desk. He's been burning letters.
217777	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Don't you want to know what I've been doing today?
220720	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I'm sorry - I haven't thanked you for your kindness last night.
225555	<strong>If you hadn't taken me in, I wouldn't have had anywhere to stay.
229600	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Well. I've been to North Hill.
232222	Mr Bassat invited me and others to discuss the murder.
236863	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Does Mr Bassat <strong>suspect</strong> anyone?
239222	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>They've found the man, Harry. He can't be the murderer though.
243666	<strong>He would have been a suspect if he hadn't been locked up in the room by the bar for the last few days.
249111	But he said that someone else gave your uncle orders. This person must be the murderer. Don't you agree?
257999	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Well...er. Yes, I suppose.
263400	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>It can't be one of the men. This person is clever.
267444	He must have come to the inn and he knows the moor well.
271968	He probably lives nearby. Did anyone like this come to the inn?
277700	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Er...no. I can't think.
282777	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Why do you look so anxious, Mary? But I forgot.
287250	I saw a friend of yours today at North Hill.
289700	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I have no friends except you.
292333	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>But you told me you went to Launceston with your uncle's brother.
296285	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I froze. I didn't know what to say.
301666	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>He gave me a message for you. Tell her that "I'm sorry". I.
307888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Jem was at North Hill? Why?
311000	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Well, he's the dead man's brother. He wasn't upset, though.
315777	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Was Mr Bassat asking him questions?
318555	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>They've been talking all day. He's got brains - more than his brother.
323900	You told me he lives nearby, and steals horses?
328999	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I can't look at him, but I feel his eyes studying my face. He knows the truth.
338000	<strong>Mary<br></strong>What will they do to him, Mr Davey?
340777	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>'Do'? What do you mean? I'm sure he won't be punished since he has helped them.
348000	<strong>Mary<br></strong>'Helped'? I don't understand.
351077	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Mary, it was Jem who <strong>informed</strong> Mr Bassat about his own brother.
356222	They left Launceston together after the horse market.
359111	Mr Bassat told him he could go free if he gave them <strong>proof </strong>about his brother and he did.
366264	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I can't believe it. I was so sure.
371111	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh, Vicar, I'm such a fool. Where is Jem now?
377238	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>He's gone to find the <strong>blacksmith</strong>.
379326	He found a <strong>nail</strong> in the field by the inn. It must belong to the killer's horse.
385678	Only one person went to the blacksmith yesterday.
389353	<strong>Mary<br></strong>How do you know?
391333	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Because I know who that person was.
400800	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>His strange eyes are staring at me.
404988	I can't breathe! He knows who the murderer is!
411000	Meet me in the next episode when I finally discover the shocking truth about who killed my aunt and uncle at Jamaica Inn.
419666	I am also in danger but who will come to my rescue?
