1	(Introduction...)
26800	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Day 7 - we're in the Cape Verde islands and, no, we didn't sink! We have made it to port.
34600	<em>There was a small hole in the tanks that store our drinking water and someone is now fixing it.
42200	<em>But I'm glad we stopped here- <strong>the islands here are like another world</strong> - green, lush, warm and sunny - <strong>not like the concrete jungle we left at home</strong>.
55800	<em>Unfortunately, we can't stay here for long - we are in a race after all, around the world.
63900	<em>There's just time to take a 'selfie' to send back to my friends (click) - oh and I must just log on and check my emails.
78100	<strong>Phil<br></strong>So there's an email from John who says.
82386	he hopes our trip is going well... and to remind me, that as part of the challenge, I have to bring back some rare, unusual souvenirs - and he wants a recording of some traditional music.
97500	Hmmm, what could that be?
100000	<strong>PP<br></strong>Phil, everything is fixed. I've filled up with drinking water. It didn't cost much and the chap who fixed it gave me this CD - something for us to listen to on the yacht.
113200	<strong>Phil<br></strong>What is it?
114300	<strong>PP<br></strong>I don't know. It's just a CD of the local <em>Morna</em> music.
119500	<strong>Phil</strong><br><strong>What does it sound like?
121300	<strong>PP<br></strong>He said <strong>it's a bit like blues music</strong>. Have a listen.
125200	<strong>Phil<br></strong>That's brilliant Passepartout! What would I do without you?!
133800	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Day 10 - and I'm out in the Atlantic Ocean - and what a big ocean it is when you look at it from our small yacht, The Mermaid.
143379	It is miles and miles of blue and grey water with nothing to see on the horizon.
150600	But we've got a good tail wind and we seem to be making good progress.
156800	Passepartout is at the wheel, steering our yacht to our next destination - St Helena. I'm helping out by making tea.
169200	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Cup of tea, Passepartout?
171800	<strong>PP <br></strong>More tea! OK then, it will help me concentrate.
176200	The sea is getting quite rough and I need your help up here on deck.
181700	<strong>RADIO MESSAGE:<br></strong><em>Attention all shipping. A deep depression is forming in the South Atlantic, moving north.
187300	Severe gale force 11 winds are expected with heavy rain</em>. <em>Visibility will be poor.
193500	<strong>PP<br></strong>Strong wind. Heavy rain. Sounds nasty. We're going to have to change direction.
201100	Get your waterproof clothes on - we're in for a wet and bumpy ride.
207900	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>The weather is already getting bad.
210300	The wind is very strong and the rain is hammering down and stinging our faces.
215888	Not my favourite weather - I prefer the calm, warm, sunny type.
222750	But we have no choice - we need to find shelter.
227600	Passepartout says we should go to some islands at 0.3 degrees north, 6.6 degrees east.
235900	Where could that be? And will we make it before the storm gets us?
244700	This was a dream trip - and suddenly <strong>it's like a nightmare</strong></em>
257000	<strong>PP<br></strong>Phil what are you doing? Hold onto that rope. Don't let go or we'll lose the sail.
268711	<strong>Phil <br></strong>OK. It's getting very dark. Do you know which way to go?
274300	<strong>PP <br></strong>Yes - of course I do - we do have a satellite navigation system.
278900	According to this, we're not too far from the coast - but I can't see anything.
284900	<strong>Phil</strong> <br>Look! I can see lights of Sao Tome. Is that a lighthouse? Is it a harbour?
292200	<strong>PP <br></strong>Yes.I think it is. but I don't know how we're going to land in these stormy seas.
299300	We're just going to hit the rocks.
301800	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Hey look! There's someone on the harbour wall waving their arms.
306400	Let's get closer. Is it a mermaid?
310200	<strong>PP<br></strong>A mermaid? She has legs.
313200	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Over here. Quick! Throw me the rope.
321700	<strong>Phil</strong> <br><em>Phew. What luck! We're on dry land, safe from the storm and it's all thanks to the help of a woman who lives on the island.
334800	She's invited us to her house to dry off and warm up. But are we in the right place?
348700	<strong>Phil</strong> <br>Thanks so much for helping us - you saved our boat - and our lives.
355300	<strong>Sophia</strong> <br>My name is Sophia. I'm happy to have helped.
358814	Here you are - try some bobofrito and a cup of hot chocolate.
364100	<strong>PP</strong> <br>Mmm, nice. <strong>They taste like banana</strong>.
368208	<strong>Sophia</strong> <br>That's what they are - bobofrito is banana fried in coconut oil. Do you like it?
375200	<strong>Phil <br></strong>Do I like it? It's amazing...just...let...me get some more. Mmmm.
383400	<strong>Sophia</strong> <br>So tell me, what are you guys doing here?
386300	<strong>PP</strong> <br>We're sailing round the world but we needed to shelter from the storm.
390900	We were heading for St Helena...is that right, Phil?
394700	<strong>Phil</strong> <br>What? Oh yes, that's right.
398826	Sorry, I was enjoying this delicious hot chocolate. It tastes great too.
404100	<strong>Sophia</strong> <br>It's made with our finest cacao beans. It's what Sao Tome and Principe is famous for.
409900	<strong>Phil</strong> <br>Cacao beans! That's great because they are one of the things I have to collect as part of my challenge. Can I take some with me?
419900	<strong>Sophia</strong> <br>Your challenge?
421300	<strong>PP</strong> <br>Yes, we're sailing around the world from London back to London in 80 days. It's a stupid idea, isn't it?
429866	<strong>Sophia</strong> <br>Hmm, well maybe not. Actually, you can have a bag of these beans if you can do me a favour?
438300	<strong>Phil</strong> <br>I'm sure we can help you.
444100	<strong>Phil <br></strong><em>Sophia has told me she was also sailing around the world when she stopped in Sao Tome for a rest and ended up falling in love with a man who she then married.
458102	<em>But her husband has started being cruel to her and she wants to leave the island and go home.
467020	<em>Because she's got no money, she wants us to give her a lift back to Britain. The long way round!
474900	<em>She is an experienced sailor, so how can we refuse?
481400	<em>There is only one problem - we'll need to work out how she can escape without her husband noticing.This is exciting stuff!
