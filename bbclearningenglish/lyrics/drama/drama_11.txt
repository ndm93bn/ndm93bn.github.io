1	(Introduction...)
20900	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>My name is Mary, Mary Yellan. I'm 23 years old.
30800	<strong>I'm not usually very brave, but I feel brave today.</strong>
37146	Here I am...on this long journey to Cornwall...on my own.
45800	<strong>I've left the farm</strong> where <strong>I've lived all my life</strong>.
49888	I wanted to stay there, but last week I made a promise to my dear Mother.
59003	<strong>Mother<br></strong>[coughing/weak voice] Mary, my child...listen. I won't be in this world much longer.
73555	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Don't say that, Mother.
76111	<strong>Mother<br></strong>It's true, Mary. But, before I go, <strong>I have only one wish</strong>.
81333	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, Mother dear?
83222	<strong>Mother<br></strong>When I die, promise me you will go and live with my sister, Patience.
87999	<strong>Mary<br></strong>But why can't I stay here on the farm, here in Helford?
92338	<strong>Mother<br></strong>You can't stay here alone.
94689	<strong>Mary<br></strong>But <strong>I haven't seen Patience since I was a child</strong>!
98562	<strong>Mother<br></strong>I know, but soon she will be the only family you have.
102716	[coughing] <strong>I have written to her. She has agreed</strong> that you can go and live with her and your uncle Joshua.
111174	<strong>They live on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall</strong>. Here, take her letter.
116979	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Bodmin Moor! But that's so far away!
126402	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>Mother died last Tuesday. The funeral was yesterday. We buried her next to Papa.
136918	<strong>Now, I'm on my way to my aunt's house. I've got the letter here</strong>.
143035	[reading]<strong> Joss and I now live in Jamaica Inn</strong>, where he is <strong>landlord</strong>.
153000	It's on the road between Bodmin and Launceston. This journey is so long!
166200	We have been travelling for hours. What a wild and lonely county Cornwall is.
174900	My only <strong>consolation </strong>is that I will see my aunt again after so many years.
179448	Oh how pretty she was with her golden hair and blue eyes! Always laughing, enjoying ourselves.
190749	But <strong>I never visited her </strong>and I never met her husband either.
197000	Ah, at last, I can see houses and people - this must be Bodmin town.
208000	There is just me and one other traveller left. It's so cold and grey outside.
216249	<strong>The rain is lashing against the window</strong>. I wish it would stop!
221186	All I can see is mile upon mile of empty <strong>moorland</strong>.
225651	No trees...no houses. I wonder how many more hours we have to travel?
235000	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Excuse me, sir - is it much further?
237867	<strong>Man<br></strong><strong>Where are you going?
239053	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Jamaica Inn. <strong>Do you know it?
241222	<strong>Man<br></strong>Maybe I do and maybe I don't...and <strong>why are you going there?
245666	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I'm going to live there...with my aunt and uncle.
248962	<strong>Man<br></strong>That will be Joss Merlyn.
251035	<strong>People say that queer things go on at Jamaica Inn</strong>.
254800	<strong>Mary<br></strong><strong>What do you mean - queer?
257144	<strong>Man<br></strong>It's just what they say. But <strong>respectable people don't go there any more</strong>. It's a lonely place.
265000	<strong>Man<br></strong>If I were you, Miss, I would go on to Launceston tonight and go back to Bodmin tomorrow.
271666	<strong>Mary<br></strong>But I can't. <strong> My aunt and uncle are waiting for me.
275300	<strong>Man<br></strong>Jamaica Inn is no place for a young woman.
277666	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I have nowhere else to go.
281134	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>What can he mean by 'queer things'? <strong>Why is he looking at me in that curious way?
289313	<strong>Driver<br></strong>Whoa boy.! Slow now.
295172	<strong>Mary<br></strong><strong>Why have we stopped here</strong> - it's the middle of nowhere?
299000	<strong>Driver<br></strong>Jamaica Inn! There you go Miss.
304444	<strong>Mary<br></strong>But there's nothing here! Oh - what's that?
310294	There up on the <strong>moor</strong> - a dark building with tall chimneys.
315488	I can see a path to the door. There's a sign twisting in the wind. It says 'Jamaica Inn'.
326111	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>Suddenly <strong>I feel frightened. I want to climb back in the coach.
331777	Too late - <strong>it's already gone</strong>. I suppose my only choice now is to enter Jamaica Inn.
345000	Next time we meet - I get to meet my Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss.
352359	I discover what a mean and scary man my uncle is.
357000	And I discover a locked room - what is inside?
