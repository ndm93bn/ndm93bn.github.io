12016	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14597	I'm Sophie.
15514	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Watashi-wa</em> <em>Ni-ru</em>.
16773	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>What did you say?
17669	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Watashi-wa</em> <em>Ni-ru</em>.
19290	'I'm Neil.
20293	' It's Japanese, Sophie.
22149	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Very good, Neil!
23749	So your Japanese language lessons are going well, then?
27141	<strong>Neil<br></strong>They are indeed.
28101	And did you know, Sophie, that scientists believe learning a second language can boost brainpower?
33925	<strong>Bilingualism</strong> - or speaking two languages equally well - is a form of brain training.
39152	<strong>Sophie<br></strong><strong>Brain training</strong> is where you're learning ways to increase your memory or intelligence.
43674	That's great Neil - but you're not exactly.
46725	bilingual.
47834	are you?
48709	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Not yet.
49925	No.
50352	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, brain training is the subject of today's show.
53978	And ways to train your brain might be doing a crossword puzzle, playing chess, or studying a new language!
60784	Now I have a question for you, Neil.
63322	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I hope my brain is up to the challenge.
65477	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I'm sure it is.
66714	Can you tell me: How many <strong>neurons</strong> - or nerve cells - are there in the typical human brain?
72752	Is it . <br>a) 8.6 billion<br>b) 86 billion<br>Or c) 860 billion
81029	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hmm. I'm going to say a) 8.6 billion.
84485	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not.
88730	But now let's listen to neuropsychologist Dr Catherine Loveday talking about why being bilingual may protect your brain from damage if you have a stroke.
99845	<strong>INSERT<br>Dr Catherine Loveday, neuropsychologist<br></strong>I think the theory behind why bilingualism might be a protective factor is that [it] involves a lot of switchings - a lot of attentional changes - lots of switching.
110213	And that seems to exercise the sort of executive parts of our brain.
113456	Those parts of the brain are kind of stronger and fitter when it comes to resisting some kind of damage from the stroke.
120154	<strong>Neil<br></strong>A <strong>stroke</strong> is a serious illness that occurs when blood flow to an area of the brain is cut off.
126746	And <strong>executive functions</strong> are the mental skills involved in doing things like problem solving and planning.
133445	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>So when a bilingual speaker <strong>switches </strong>- or changes - from one language to another - this exercises the executive parts of their brain, making it stronger and fitter.
145434	And because the brain is stronger, it's able to <strong>resist</strong> - or prevent - damage caused by a stroke.
152602	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But many of us aren't bilingual are we?
154885	So our brains aren't going to be protected against strokes.
158256	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Don't worry, Neil.
159600	There are other things you can do to exercise your brain.
162906	If you're right handed, doing tasks like brushing your teeth with your left hand will stimulate your brain - or getting dressed in the dark with your eyes shut.
172506	Or simply memorizing a list of words, for example your shopping list.
177200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Doing things with the wrong hand sounds hard.
180528	But the shopping list thing sounds easier.
182277	OK.
182981	Let's see.
183493	pizza, doughnuts, crisps, bottle of coke, chocolate cake.
192282	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>That's not a very healthy list, Neil!
194330	A good diet is also important in keeping your brain fit and healthy.
199216	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Maybe I should cut down on the chocolate cake then?
202608	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Actually, that's one thing you could leave on the list.
206341	According to research, chocolate may <strong>enhance</strong> - or improve - cognitive performance, and that is your ability to acquire and utilize knowledge.
217562	Now let's listen to Dr Loveday talking about building up our <strong>cognitive reserve</strong> - this is the idea of building up extra abilities to help protect the brain against declining memory or thinking.
230362	<strong><span data-mce-mark="1">INSERT<br>Dr Catherine Loveday, neuropsychologist<br></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Continually just stimulating the brain - things like learning a language, learning music, just educating yourself, seems to continue to build up that cognitive reserve.
241904	So even if people take up languages or take up other things later in life it will give them a degree of protection.
246768	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Stimulate</strong> means to make something become more active.
251802	Hmm. Not sure I'm continually stimulating my brain.
256346	What do you think, Sophie?
257392	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>With all our stimulating discussions, Neil, I'm sure we're both building up our cognitive reserve.
263344	And there are your Japanese lessons too.
266010	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, so I am doing well as far as my cognitive reserve goes.
270341	Sophie you've put my mind at rest.
272453	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And if you <strong>put someone's mind at rest</strong> you stop them worrying.
276208	Well, don't get too relaxed Neil - your brain needs constant stimulation, remember?
281797	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hmm. I think I might just lie down after the show with a box of chocolates and today's crossword.
286213	or maybe I'll memorize another shopping list.
289136	this time in Japanese.
290650	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>OK.
291589	I think it's time to hear the answer to today's quiz question.
295429	I asked: How many neurons are there in the typical human brain?
300122	Is it .
301040	a) 8.6 billion b) 86 billion or c) 860 billion?
308101	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said a) 8.6 billion.
310725	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I thought you were feeling clever today, Neil.
313008	I'm afraid that's the wrong answer.
315525	It's b) 86 billion.
318277	But do you know how scientists calculated that number?
321968	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Did they have a guess, Sophie?
324186	<strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Sophie<br></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">No, not exactly.
325914	Apparently, the easiest way is to count how many neurons there are in one part of the brain and then multiply that for the rest of the brain's volume.
335152	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's a lot of brain cells.
337264	OK, can we hear the words we learned today?
339973	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>They are:<br>bilingualism<br>brain training<br>neurons<br>stroke<br>executive functions<br>switches<br>resist<br>enhance<br>cognitive reserve<br>stimulate<br>put someone's mind at rest
360773	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
363546	Don't forget to join us again soon!
365957	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.
