11784	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14946	I'm Alice.
15707	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>And I'm Rob.
16405	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Did I see you arriving in a huge red pick-up truck this morning?
20508	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes - it's great, isn't it?
22330	<strong>Alice<br></strong>It's very big.
23948	and red.
26023	But Rob, aren't you a supporter of the movement to preserve the environment?
31219	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Erm.
31905	Yes.
32232	<strong>Alice<br></strong>A gas-guzzling car for an environmentalist, Rob?
36957	Isn't that a contradiction - aren't you being a hypocrite?
40434	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, it's very fuel-efficient, Alice.
42729	It's quite eco-friendly actually.
45446	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's ridiculous and you know it.
48608	Hypocrisy is the subject of today's show, and maybe we should start by exploring the meaning of hypocrite.
56120	Can you tell me what did the Ancient Greek word 'hypocrite' originally mean?
61870	Was it.
62838	<br>a) actor<br>b) politician<br>Or c) horse?
67723	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, that's easy.
68980	I think it's b) politician.
70688	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show.
75375	Now, these days the meaning has changed, and a <strong>hypocrite</strong> means somebody who says one thing and does another.
83160	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Like you telling me not to bite my nails because it's a disgusting habit.
87600	and then I see you doing it later the same day.
90676	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hmm.
91311	Well, sometimes it's hard to be consistent.
94375	I do think nail biting is disgusting - but then when I'm a bit nervous I do it without thinking.
100306	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We're often inconsistent in what we say or do, though, aren't we?
104094	<strong>Inconsistent</strong> means changeable.
106961	<strong>Alice<br></strong>There is an explanation for us sometimes saying one thing and behaving in a very different way.
111905	Let's listen to Professor Clancy Martin at the University of Missouri in the US.
117430	He teaches Philosophy so he knows a thing or two about the way we think.
121632	<strong>INSERT<br> Clancy Martin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, US<br></strong>So while you might be enormously compassionate in your role as a teacher or a parent, you might find yourself being quite harsh and direct when it comes to your role as a brother or a sister.
138320	So then you see that - now wait a second if I've got all these inconsistencies all over the place in my character can I really say that I'm a sincere and authentic individual?
150028	Or am I just kind of blowing with which ever way my relationship winds kind of incline me?
155360	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Professor Clancy Martin.
158233	So we play different roles in life and these roles may seem contradictory but they're just part of being the same person.
165973	Sometimes you're a bit harsh and direct with me, Alice, aren't you?
169296	Do you see yourself as my sister?
171216	She used to pick on me.
172523	<br><br><strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Harsh </strong>means stern and unkind.
175014	I don't mean to be unkind to you, Rob.
177402	Maybe I could try and be more <strong>compassionate</strong> towards you - it means show a bit of sympathy and concern now and then.
183499	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Offer me good words.
185510	At least promise you'll be nice to me.
187692	That you'll bring me tea and biscuits.
189518	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's what politicians do.
191598	They promise they will do what people want and .
195046	often they don't.
196620	And it's a big problem for them.
198803	Let's talk about politicians and hypocrisy.
201541	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They have to express opinions about so many things that it's easy to catch them out being hypocritical.
207633	- and then we, the public, get morally indignant about it.
211520	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
212222	To <strong>catch somebody out</strong> means to discover they have made a mistake.
216260	And <strong>morally indignant</strong> means being angry about something, according to principles of right and wrong.
222885	Let's listen to Professor Martin again talking about the difficulties of being a politician.
228427	<strong>INSERT<br> Clancy Martin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, US<br></strong>I think in our contemporary democracy it's become obvious to most of us that the views that we expect from our politicians and the kinds of views that get our politicians elected are.
244545	may be completely incongruous with the way they lead their personal lives and what they personally believe.
253287	And this is how it can become very morally pernicious.
256310	very morally dangerous.
257781	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK, so we elect politicians based on their views - for example on the environment, on education, on foreign policy.
267664	But their public views may be <strong>incongruous</strong> - or not in agreement with - their personal views.
274338	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And the difference between their public and personal views can be <strong>pernicious</strong> - it means deadly or destructive.
280311	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Politicians are under scrutiny all the time - their personal lives, their public statements.
286143	Now with social media, a thoughtless comment <strong>goes viral</strong> - or spreads very quickly via the internet.
292565	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's true.
293346	And actually.
294262	I posted a photo of my red pick-up truck earlier.
297299	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Has it gone viral, Rob?
298726	<strong>Rob<br></strong>No, but there is a negative comment from the local conservationists.
303071	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh dear.
304224	Well, Rob, I think it's time I told you the answer to today's quiz question.
308967	I asked: What did the Ancient Greek word 'hypocrite' originally describe?
314864	Was it.
315669	a) actor, b) politician or c) horse.
320293	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And I said b) politician.
322138	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid!
325228	<em>Hypokrites</em> was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure.
332572	In Athens in the 4th century BC, the great orator Demosthenes ridiculed a rival politician, who had been a successful actor.
342217	Well, we're running out of time so can we hear the words we learned today?
347008	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They are:<br>hypocrite<br>inconsistent<br>harsh<br>compassionate<br>catch somebody out<br>morally indignant<br>incongruous<br>pernicious<br>go viral
364601	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
367385	Don't forget to join us again soon!
369012	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye.
