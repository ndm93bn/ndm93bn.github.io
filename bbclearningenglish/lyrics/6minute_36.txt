1	( Introduction... )
11869	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.
14886	<strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I'm Neil.
15630	<strong>Alice<br></strong>We're talking about old technology today, Neil.
18617	Did you use to have any old tech, you know, a Walkman, back in the 1990s? Before music went digital?
24486	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No. I didn't have a Walkman. But I do have a record player.
28273	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I know you like flared trousers, but I didn't realize you were that retro.
32747	A <strong>record player</strong>, for those of you who don't know, is a box with a <strong>turntable</strong> - or turning plate that you put your vinyl records on to play them.
41645	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>retro</strong> means going back to styles and fashions from the past. Well, I love my record player.
47430	I have a large collection of vinyl records, as well as cassette tapes that I inherited from my parents.
53244	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Vinyl</strong> is the plastic that records are made from.
56575	And <strong>cassette tapes</strong> came after records - which are these small plastic cases with audiotape on reels inside them.
64607	Well, I don't understand your fondness for out-dated stuff, Neil.
68520	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Don't be so quick to dismiss old tech, Alice.
71254	There's been a <strong>resurgence</strong> - or new rise in - record sales recently - here in the UK, and in the US.
77210	Some DJs have gone back to using them, and new record stores have opened to meet the demand for vinyl.
83254	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Really?
84051	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, really. In fact, I have a question for you, Alice: How many records were sold in the UK in 2014?
91717	Was it. <br>a) 10,000? <br>b) 100,000? <br>Or c) 1 million?
97908	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, I think it's b) 100,000.
103583	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We'll find out if you're right or wrong later in the show.
106401	For myself, I just think vinyl sounds nicer than digital - has a warmer quality.
111670	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That sounds a bit technical, Neil!
113730	Don't you think this retro trend has more to do with nostalgia for the past?
117750	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Nostalgia</strong> means thinking about the past with a mixture of warm feelings and sadness.
122953	Well, yes, I think people who grew up with the old technology probably are nostalgic about it.
128752	Let's listen to music journalist Jacqueline Springer talking about cassette tapes and what they mean to her.
135165	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Jacqueline Springer, music journalist<br></strong>They were audio love letters. They were ways in which you started to carve out your own identity so you know when Dan or I have interviewed people we talk about.
146642	we talk to musicians about their impressions and, you know, and their influences, and invariably it was siblings or parents. And you would raid those vinyl albums and you would self-select.
156810	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Jacqueline Springer there. So she calls cassette tapes 'audio love letters' - because people often <strong>compiled</strong> - or put together - their own collection of songs on tapes and gave them to the boy or girl they liked.
170996	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Jacqueline says they recorded songs from their parents' record collections onto tape.
176124	And it seems that this process helped create their musical and social identity.
180763	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. I identified with The Rolling Stones, The Clash, and The Sex Pistols when I was a teen.
185765	How about your musical identity, Alice?
188132	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, I was in love with all the boy bands from the 1990s - NSync, Westlife, Backstreet Boys, Take That.
194989	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Unbelievable. I can see I need to make you some decent tapes of music from the 90s, Alice.
200699	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I didn't say I still like boy bands, Neil. I'm not nostalgic for my lost teenage years - unlike you.
207460	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Old tech is everywhere.
209205	Did you know that the US nuclear weapons force still uses a computer system dating back to the 1970s with 8-inch floppy disks?
217374	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Floppy disks</strong>? You mean those flexible plastic computer disks used for storing data magnetically.
223938	Well, I can't believe the guys in The Pentagon are nostalgic about floppy disks.
228708	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, a Pentagon spokesperson said it would be extremely expensive to update the system and it still works.
234765	They plan to do it by 2020 and save a lot of space for sure.
238660	You would need more than 130,000 8-inch floppy disks to store 32GB of information.
245871	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Wow! This is the equivalent of an average memory stick!
249382	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. But there are more people out there keen on old tech.
253024	How do you think a DVD rental stores survives in this era of online movie streaming?
258377	Let's listen to Tara Judah, co-director of UK rental store 20th Century Flicks and find out.
264972	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Tara Judah, Co-director, 20<sup>th</sup> Century Flicks<br></strong>We've survived because of the experience of coming into this store. Um. It's a very human experience. It's human interaction.
274667	People come here because they want to talk to somebody who's really knowledgeable about film.
279383	They want to have a recommendation or a conversation about the films they just watch. You know, they really want to discuss those things.
287093	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So it's back to the idea of human contact - we like compiling lists of music and sharing them with our friends and loved ones.
295223	Sharing a playlist through iTunes or Spotify isn't quite the same, though.
299822	We like talking people about the films we watch.
302680	<strong>Alice<br></strong>You can always talk to me, Neil.
305017	Now how about giving me the answer to today's quiz question?
308897	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I asked: How many records were sold in the UK in 2014?
313339	Was it. <br>a) 10,000 <br>b) 100,000? <br>Or c) 1 million?
318207	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I said b) 100,000.
320781	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And, Alice, you were in fact totally wrong!
326468	The answer is c).
328520	Vinyl is booming - in 2014, sales passed 1million albums in the UK for the first time since 1996.
336959	The format has been steadily increasing, thanks in part to the popularity of guitar bands, traditionally associated with records.
344884	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Now let's hear words we learned today.
348003	They are:<br>record player<br>turntable<br>retro<br>vinyl<br>cassette tapes<br>resurgence<br>nostalgia<br>compiled<br>floppy disk
364693	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon!
369493	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye!
