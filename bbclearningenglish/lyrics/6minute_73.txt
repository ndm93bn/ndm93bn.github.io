1	(Introduction)
12800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English- the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I'm Rob.
23500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'm Catherine. In this programme we'll be discussing <strong>quitting</strong> drinking and staying dry.
29600	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Right, so when you say 'quitting', you mean 'giving up' - and when you say 'drinking', you're particularly referring to 'the activity of drinking alcohol'.
37633	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly Rob.
38888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But, what about staying dry? It's nothing to do with the weather?
42511	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>No that's true. The adjective 'dry' here means 'no alcohol'. And I, Rob, am currently having a dry January.
52055	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Ah yes, your New Year's <strong>resolution</strong> is to give up alcohol for one month. Any reason?
56555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. I'm doing it in order to improve my health and save some money.
61666	And a resolution, by the way, is a promise to yourself to do something or not to do something.
68111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well they seem like good reasons. And for now, we must keep up our resolution to always start the programme with a question, so are you ready for it, Catherine?
75999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I am, crack on, Rob!
77777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>According to data from the World Health Organisation in 2015, which country consumed to most alcohol per person?
85593	Was it. <br>a) Australia <br>b) Finland <br>c) The Czech Republic
90666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well they're sound quite likely, but I did visit Prague once and I had a lovely time, so I'm going to say c) the Czech Republic.
100555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well as always, we'll find out the answer later on.
103800	But let's continue our discussion about drinking - or informally known as boozing - and trying to give it up.
110000	We all know that too much drinking can be bad for us and that's why you Catherine, have decided to quit - but only for a month.
116699	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes just a month but it's a start and I might continue into February.
121666	But I'm seeing the benefits already. I've managed <strong>to shed</strong> some weight - most of which I actually put on over Christmas!
128000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I can see. So <strong>to shed</strong> here simply means 'lose'. And I bet your <strong>sobriety</strong> is helping you sleep better. Sobriety, by the way, means 'the state of not being drunk'.
137855	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is actually. And I'm not alone: A study of 857 British adults by Dr Richard de Visser from the University of Sussex found that after going for a month without alcohol, 62% of the people in the study said they had better sleep.
155600	So Rob, does that tempt you to become teetotal and stop drinking?
160666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Not me Catherine. I need a drink to help me relax and be more sociable - you know how shy I am!
166777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes of course Rob! Well, maybe you should listen to Catherine Gray. She's the author of a book called The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober, which she wrote after she discovered the negative effects of going to too many work-related parties where she was just drinking too much. Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme.
190900	<strong>Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober<br></strong>I had a lot of social anxiety and when I quit I had to deal with that. I think I used drinking as a <strong>crutch</strong>, a confidence crutch - it eased the way to go to big glittering parties and stuff like that and when I quit I had to learn real confidence in a way.
206333	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>So Catherine worked in the magazine business which involved going to lots of boozy parties.
213300	Drinking, she says, helped herdeal with a nervous and worried feeling that she had when she met new people - she called it social anxiety.
221333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, and she used drinking as a <strong>crutch</strong>. A crutch here is something you depend on for support - and sometimes you rely on it too much.
229599	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes and eventually she decided to <strong>abstain</strong> from drinking - in other words stop doing something that is enjoyable but bad for you - and she feels much better for it.
239312	So come on Rob, haven't you got the willpower to just quit drinking for just 30 days?
244666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well according to Catherine Gray, that wouldn't be long enough.
248066	<strong>Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober<br> </strong>Experts say that it takes 66 days for a new habit to <strong>bed in</strong>, so I would always recommend trying it for 90 days.
254656	30 days is the hard bit before you get to the rewards. Because after 66 days it starts getting a lot easier and you start feeling better in yourself.
264050	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, so it takes 66 days for doing a regular activity - a habit - to <strong>bed in</strong>.
270777	And 'bed in' means to 'become normal and start working properly'.
275528	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now, earlier I asked you, according to data from the World Health Organisation in 2015, which country consumed the most alcohol per person?
285290	Was it. <br>a) Australia <br>b) Finland <br>c) The Czech Republic
290751	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I said the Czech Republic. Was I right?
293555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>You were Catherine. Spot on, well done. Apparently, 14.1 litres of pure alcohol is consumed per person each year.
301700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well like I said, they do make good beer in the Czech Republic - but people, be careful, only drink it in moderation.
309268	Now Rob, shall we take a look at the vocabulary we've mentioned today?
313008	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Indeed. The first word we had was <strong>resolution</strong> - that's a promise to yourself to do or not do something.
320206	'Catherine's New Year's resolution was to give up drinking alcohol for a whole month.'
324666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and I'm still doing it Rob - the plan is <strong>to shed</strong> a few kilos and get fit.
330037	So for example, 'Rob shed lots of weight when he went on a cake-free diet!'
335700	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Really? I'd never give up cake Catherine, but I could be tempted to give up booze as I know <strong>sobriety </strong>is good for my health - that's the noun word to mean 'the state of not being drunk'.
346000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now our next word was <strong>abstain</strong>. That means 'not do something that is enjoyable but bad for you'.
352887	'Rob needs to abstain from eating cakes if he wants to wear his skinny jeans.'
359166	<strong>Rob</strong><br> Are you dropping a hint there, Catherine? Now, our final word is actually two words - <strong>bed in</strong>.
365261	It means 'to become normal and start working properly'. 'It took a while for the new computer system to bed in but now it's working perfectly.'
373111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's brilliant because now we can go online and find more BBC Learning English programmes at bbclearningenglish.com.
380203	That's all for today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed it. Bye for now.
384444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Bye.
