12888	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.
16777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.
17777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Where's...your beard?
19666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I, uh, shaved it off. I fancied a change. Beards are such a thing these days.
24583	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yup, ever since beards became a thing, I've found them a bit boring.
29000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>'A thing'. Of course, we know what the word 'thing' normally means, but what does 'a thing' mean here?
35222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Our phrase for today means 'a trend' or 'something recognisable in popular culture'.
41009	If beards are 'a thing', it means they've become fashionable: lots of people have them.
46777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. Cats on the internet - they're a thing.
49400	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh, fidget spinners. They're definitely a thing.
52400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Fidget spinners?
53500	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, those little metal or plastic toys that you spin on your finger. Know them?
58999	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, those things that kids everywhere are playing with.
61942	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Not just kids. Anyway. What else is a thing? Listen to these examples.
70555	<strong>Examples<br></strong>Using funny GIFs in your message is such a thing.
75294	You know parkour: the sport of running and jumping across buildings? Why is that such a thing?
82171	Organic powdered food. Since when has that been a thing?
91242	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>A well-known use of this phrase was after American personality Kim Kardashian posted a picture of herself pregnant, with the words "pregnancy lips".
101333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's not a term that many people had heard of, and prompted responses like this: "Pregnancy lips? Is that even a thing?"
108555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, when someone refers to a trend you haven't heard of, or that you doubt exists, feel free to respond with 'is that even a thing?'
117666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But there's little doubt the phrase 'a thing' is itself 'a thing' - it's now been included in major dictionaries.
124200	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>There we are. A thing. No plans to grow the beard back, then?
128555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Only when being clean-shaven becomes too much of a thing!
132209	<strong>Feifei and Neil<br></strong>Bye.
