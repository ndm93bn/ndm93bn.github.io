14662	<strong>Feifei<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.
18383	<strong>Rob<br></strong>...and I'm Rob.
19186	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> Rob...are you in a rush to go home today?
22396	<strong>Rob</strong><br> Err no Feifei. Why, do you want to go for a drink?
25833	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> Well sort of. A friend of mine is visiting and I'd like to go for a drink her.
32123	You could join us later if you like?
35029	<strong>Rob</strong><br> Oh I see! I've got your number!
37797	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> Err yes - you have - so you can call me and meet us later. OK?
42732	<strong>Rob</strong><br> No - I mean I know what you're trying to do.
45314	You want to go to the pub now and leave me to present the rest of this programme?
50102	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> Well.
51791	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I know what you're up to! Well you can't go until we've heard some more examples.
58937	<strong>Examples<br></strong>So I'll cook and you wash up?
61991	Hmm, I've got your number; you're just going to watch TV all evening.
67650	You can't fool me, I've got your number - you're never going to pay me back.
72301	Watch out, he's got your number - he knows what you're up to.
81003	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>OK Rob - if you say 'I've got your number' it means you understand what someone it trying to do or why they are behaving in a certain way.
89839	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Exactly - it's not about having your telephone number.
93130	I knew when you asked me if I was rushing home you were after something.
97005	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>What - so I could sneak out early to go for a drink?
101372	Honestly, who do you think I am?!
104220	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well it sounded like you were planning something.
106686	but maybe I misunderstood you.
108822	You wouldn't leave me here alone, would you, Feifei?
111628	Feifei? Feifei? Oh she's gone.
116173	Now where did I put her phone number. Bye.
