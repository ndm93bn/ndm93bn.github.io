6444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Morning Neil. In a rush today, were you?
9717	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Just a bit, Feifei. You know, kids, breakfast, commute. The usual. Why?
16022	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Well - I noticed your shirt isn't ironed.
19788	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Very attentive of you.
21275	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And your shirt has - ketchup on it?
24777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oops, yes - beans for breakfast.
27555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And you haven't shaved, have you?
29888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, no. Erm.
32222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>You really do need to make more of an effort.
35366	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Feifei, why are you having a go at me?
37200	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Relax, Neil. I'm just giving you the opportunity to use the phrase we are teaching, which is: 'have a go'!
44597	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well that's a relief.
45777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>'To have a go at someone', as we've just seen, means to criticise someone.
50555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. Here are some examples.
54844	<strong>Examples<br></strong>The boss really had a go at Michaela after she offended our clients.
59777	Susie had a go at her husband last night.
62444	He'd forgotten all about her birthday.
64888	Why do you always have a go at me?
67666	Why can't you say something nice?
71999	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>That's our phrase. 'To have a go at someone' - which means to criticise someone.
77436	<strong>Neil<br></strong>There. Can we be nice to each other now?
79900	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Well, we can have a go!
81600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah, very clever. 'To have a go' has another meaning - 'to try'.
86777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes - if you have a go at something, you try it.
90534	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Why don't you have a go at making an example sentence, Feifei?
93666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Ok then. I'm going to have a go at cooking a Thai curry from scratch.
98706	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Tasty. 'To have a go' meaning 'to try'.
101989	And one last thing, Feifei. Do I really look scruffy?
104988	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Not at all. Though you could shave once in a while.
109045	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I'll have a go. Just for you Feifei.
111333	<strong>Feifei</strong><strong> + Neil<br></strong>Bye.
