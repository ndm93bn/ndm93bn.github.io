12333	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.
16400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.
17333	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And Neil -we have a musical expression. Do you like rock music?
21822	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Rock. Yeah I love it.
23666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Really?
24455	<strong>Neil<br></strong>When I was younger I was in a rock band - we had it all: long hair, loud guitars, even louder drums, leather...all that jazz!
32444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Jazz? Hang on, was it a jazz or a rock band?!
36111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Aha - very funny - 'all that jazz' is our phrase today. And it has nothing to do with jazz.
42177	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Indeed, it simply means 'and so on', or 'and other similar things'.
47222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You often use it after listing things. For example: I love Christmas dinner - you've got turkey, Brussels sprouts, roast potatoes, gravy, all that jazz. It's just great.
57666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>You're not wrong. I love all that jazz too.
60666	And now you've made my mouth water, so let's take a break and listen to these examples.
69222	<strong>Examples<br></strong>I had a super lazy weekend. I woke up late, got some coffee, went for a walk, watched a couple of movies, all that jazz. It was great.
78999	I don't read celebrity gossip. You know: who's going out with who, who got plastic surgery, all that jazz. I'm just not interested!
91000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>It's often used - in a list of unpleasant or boring things.
95777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>For example: This morning I cleaned the whole house - washing, scrubbing, vacuuming, all that jazz!
100999	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, by using "jazz" to describe dull things, it's ironic and brings some humour.
106600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It does, Feifei. Especially when we compare it with the phrase to "jazz up".
111107	You can 'jazz up an outfit' or 'jazz up a meal', for example - which means to make something more interesting and even glamorous.
118777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Before we go, we should of course mention the phrase is also the name of a song from the 1975 Broadway musical, Chicago. Fancy singing it for us, Neil?
128917	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I really couldn't. After all, I was in a rock band. Not a jazz band! What about you, Feifei?
134777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Maybe next time. I can't remember the words!
137888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Excuses, excuses! Bye for now.
140458	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Bye.
