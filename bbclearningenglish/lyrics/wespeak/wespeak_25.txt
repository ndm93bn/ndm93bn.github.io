12444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello, I'm Rob.
14128	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>...And I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak. Hey, happy birthday for last week Rob.
20333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thanks Feifei, yes 21 years old - where has the time gone?
25104	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Are you sure - you don't act like a 21-year-old.
29344	<strong>Rob<br></strong>What are you saying, Feifei?
31599	<strong>Feifei <br> </strong>Well, errr, look at your clothes - they're not very trendy, they're a bit boring!
38100	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Boring?
39444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes...and come on, you're not very youthful.
43888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Youthful?!Just because I haven't got any tattoos - who wants a tattoo anyway, they look silly, don't they? And they damage the skin as well.
52222	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> There you go - old fashioned attitudes - no way're you 21!
56882	<strong>Rob</strong><br> So you're saying I am a <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong>?
59888	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> A <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> - that's an informal phrase to describe someone who is boring, dull and has old-fashioned attitudes.
67460	Let's hear some examples of this phrase.
72000	<strong>Examples<br></strong>Ling thinks I'm an old <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> because I don't drive a flashy sports car.
78222	My dad's a bit of a <strong>fuddy-duddy </strong>- he still listens to music on cassette tapes.
84568	The bank has lost many customers over the years, probably due to its <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> image.
92237	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So a <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> is someone who is old-fashioned and sometimes pompous.
97777	But Rob, being a <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> isn't all bad.
101000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh yes? Boring, old-fashioned - how can that be a good thing?
105874	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Well, you make us all laugh.
108333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes but for the wrong reasons - I'm off.
111111	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh dear, it seems like a <strong>fuddy-duddy</strong> doesn't even a sense of humour. Where are you going?
117444	<strong>Rob</strong><br> To get a tattoo done.
118822	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>It'll hurt. Bye!
