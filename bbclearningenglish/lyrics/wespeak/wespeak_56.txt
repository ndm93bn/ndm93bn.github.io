13555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello, I'm Feifei, and this is The English We Speak and today I'm with Rob. Hi Rob, how are you?
20351	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hi Feifei. I'm fine but I can't quite understand why you've brought me to a railway station.
26497	<strong>Feifei&nbsp;<br></strong>Isn't that obvious?
28143	<strong>Rob<br></strong>No. And what's that piece of paper you're waving in your hand?
32333	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh this? This is a ticket.
34999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>A ticket. Why would you bring me to a railway station and show me a ticket?
40559	It's cold and we could be in a warm studio presenting this programme.
44555	And anyway, don't you know it's my birthday and we're supposed to be going out to celebrate later?
50000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>I know it's your birthday, you told me last week and you said something about wanting a present that was 'just the ticket'. So here it is.
60428	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh Feifei - I didn't want a ticket - when I said 'just the ticket' I meant I wanted something that was exactly what I wanted or needed: A camera, a computer game or maybe a nice bottle of whisky.
73755	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh right, I see.
75666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh dear, what a wasted trip Feifei. Now we're here, let's hear some more examples of the phrase 'just the ticket'.
85698	<strong>Examples<br></strong>Oh I feel terrible: I've got a cold and my nose it blocked but a drink of hot honey and lemon would be just the ticket to make me feel better.
97748	I think a new art gallery will be just the ticket for improving the image of the town and encouraging more people to visit.
106444	Our car has got seven seats, so it's just the ticket for taking all the kids to football practice every week.
116666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So that's 'just the ticket' - which describes something that exactly what is wanted or needed.
124579	OK Rob, so you wanted something for your birthday that was 'just the ticket' - well you're looking at it.
132005	<strong>Rob<br></strong>You Feifei?
133900	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>No Rob. This ticket in my hand. Have you actually looked at it?
139777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK let me see. Wow! A train ticket to Paris, for me?
147146	That's really generous of you. Thanks Feifei! When do we go?
151213	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>We? No, it's just one ticket - I couldn't afford two.
155666	Now look, the train's about to leave so you had better go. Have a good trip!
160186	<strong>Rob</strong><br> Oh right. Well I had better go. See ya.
163999	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Bye Rob. Phew, two days in the office without Rob - that is 'just the ticket' for me!
