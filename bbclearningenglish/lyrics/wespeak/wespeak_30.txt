12555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...Hello and welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Neil. (conspiratorially) Feifei will be joining me in just a second.
19100	She's a little bit... sensitive, so I'm going to try to deliberately upset her - just to teach you an expression in English!
26836	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hi Neil
27905	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh hi Feifei! What do you think of the new Justin Bieber album?
33100	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh it's just great. I love it!
36150	<strong>Neil</strong><br> Really? (Pause) I think it's rubbish.
39600	You must have terrible taste to like Justin Bieber.
42666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Neil that's so rude!
44988	<strong>Neil</strong><br> It's not rude - it's just a difference of opinion.
47777	Honestly Feifei, you're such a snowflake.
50444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh you mean beautiful and totally unique?!
53700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Err, no. I mean you melt easily.
57333	You can call someone who gets offended or upset too easily a 'snowflake'.
62221	Here are some examples:
67744	<strong>Examples<br></strong>A so-called friend of mine deleted a comment I made on his social media page just because I didn't agree with him.
74555	What a snowflake. There are so many places you can express yourself these days but at the same time everyone gets offended so easily.
84500	You can see why it's called 'generation snowflake'.
90700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Generation snowflake. This expression refers to young adults who are too sensitive to handle criticism of their opinions.
98777	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> This is pretty insulting, Neil.
101200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It IS pretty insulting, Feifei - but you're only upset because you're such a snowflake.
106555	Though, of course you're also unique and beautiful.
109800	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh I see - trying to be nice in case you offend me?
113455	Who's the snowflake now, Neil!?
115508	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well it's just better if we all get along, isn't it? Bye!
119244	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Bye!
