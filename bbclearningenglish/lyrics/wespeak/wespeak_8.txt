1	(Introduction...)
12222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.
15850	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, it is. And hello I'm Rob.
17800	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>I don't know about you Rob, but I seem to have so much work to do at the moment.
23040	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yeah, me too. We've got to meet that deadline by Friday.
26600	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>I guess we've all got lots to do - and that's why I was surprised that Phyllis has asked to take three days off work this week.
34550	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Three days? Are you sure? Maybe she's unwell?
38250	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>No, she's fine - I heard her say to the boss in a very loud voice 'I've got a great deal on a flight to Italy so I need to take the rest of the week off.'
48900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>What cheek - she's got a <strong>brass neck</strong>.
51850	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>A <strong>brass neck</strong>? Phyllis has a <strong>brass neck</strong>!
55900	Really - when did she get that - maybe she needs a holiday to recover from the operation?
61777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>No no no Feifei. Her neck isn't actually made of brass - I just mean she is confident but also a bit rude - she can do or say things that most of us would be too embarrassed to do or say.
73600	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, she just doesn't care what she says does she?
77700	So if someone is described as having a <strong>brass neck</strong>, it means they are confident and say or do what they want but doesn't understand their behaviour might be unacceptable to others.
89770	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, she certainly doesn't worry about what other people think of her.
93111	A bit like people in these examples.
98700	<strong>Examples<br></strong>My ex-boyfriend's got a <strong>brass neck</strong>, coming round and asking me to do his washing!
106313	The customer has a <strong>brass neck</strong> asking for a refund when it was obvious he had already worn the shoes.
112805	She's got a <strong>brass neck</strong> telling the boss that he wasn't very good at his job - I would never say that!
123800	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So having a <strong>brass neck</strong> means you are extremely confident about your own actions but you don't understand that your behaviour might be unacceptable to others.
134000	So it's not like us Rob?
136000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Absolutely not. Although, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind writing the notes for the presentation we're doing?
143100	I've got to meet someone for lunch.
144800	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Ermm.
146200	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Come on Feifei, you love writing presentations.
150000	Oh why are you looking so brassed off?
152800	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Brassed off - you mean I'm looking annoyed and disappointed - maybe I'm looking brassed off because of your <strong>brass neck</strong>.
160988	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I'll take that as 'no' then. Oh well, at least you understand this English expression now!
166340	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!
