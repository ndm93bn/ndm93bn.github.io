12800	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello. I'm Feifei and this is The English We Speak.
16900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>...and hello, it's Rob here. Good weekend Feifei?
19666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Amazing - the weather was great so I went on a trip to the seaside. And you were going camping weren't you?
27000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I was but it turned out to be a bit of a <strong>wet weekend</strong>.
30111	<strong>Feifei <br> </strong>Oh no, you mean it rained? That's unlucky, the sun was out all weekend here.
36777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh well the weather was fine - but I didn't go.
39700	The car broke down again so I stayed at home, doing DIY <em>all</em> weekend - boring!
45373	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So a <strong>wet weekend</strong> doesn't have to involve rain?
49333	<strong>Rob</strong><br> Nope. A <strong>wet weekend</strong> means a boring and disappointing time.
53333	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>And it doesn't&nbsp;have to be at the weekend either?
56555	<strong>Rob</strong><br> Correct. This phrase just means the situation is boring just like a <strong>wet weekend</strong> is.

82855	I had to do my accounts yesterday - it was like a <strong>wet weekend</strong> in a paint factory!

111605	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Rain <em>all</em> weekend. Oh what's wrong? You have a face like a <strong>wet weekend</strong>!
118055	<strong>Rob</strong><br> A face like a <strong>wet weekend</strong>? You mean I look unhappy?
