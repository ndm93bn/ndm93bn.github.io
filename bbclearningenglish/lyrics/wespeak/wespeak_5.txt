12853	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak: I'm Neil.
15432	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And I'm Feifei.
16482	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You know what, Feifei, I just love living here in London.
20138	I mean, the culture, the parks, the restaurants - it's got everything.
24309	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yeah, it's not bad, though to be fair it's not the cheapest place to live.
29229	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You're right. Though most world capital cities are quite pricey to live in, to be fair.
34613	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Actually, to be fair, I think there are a lot of reasons to move out of the big city - you know, more space, better air, fewer people, and...nature!
44992	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Feifei, I think we've given good arguments on both sides, to be fair!
48773	And I hope we've demonstrated today's phrase - which is: to be fair.
53727	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>It's a phrase you'll hear a lot, especially in British English.
57743	It's used when you want to explain more than one side of an issue.
61560	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Let's listen to these examples:
64869	<strong>Examples<br></strong>We played well in the first half, but to be fair we were awful in the second half.
70733	Now, Luke. We know that wasn't your best exam result, but to be fair, you had very little time to prepare.
79754	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So - it's a phrase that we use to give balance in a discussion.
83556	And it comes just before or after making a point, or giving an opinion.
88008	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>But these days, especially in spoken English, people sometimes just use it when giving an opinion - whether or not it's really about fairness.
96671	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, for example: To be fair, The Beatles were the best band of all time.
101111	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>I think Italian food is the finest there is, to be fair.
104888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So be careful when listening out for this phrase - sometimes it's just a 'filler' phrase, something people say a lot with no real meaning.
113016	It might not always mean what you expect it to!
115904	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>To be fair, that's why we make these programmes - to help people understand real English.
121300	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And they are some of the best English learning materials available, to be fair.
125100	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Though, to be fair, other programmes are available!
127914	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Bye for now.
128732	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Bye.
