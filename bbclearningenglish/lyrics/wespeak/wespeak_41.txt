11811	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.
15666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.
16666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And Neil - you look different. I just can't tell what it is.
21900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, you mean my hair? My pink hair?
24855	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, why on earth did you do that?!
27777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah, you know me Feifei. I did it for the lolz!
30666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Right. Well, it is pretty...funny.
34999	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thanks. It's my birthday today and I thought I'd do something fun.
39000	If you do something 'for the lolz', it means you do it for fun.
42569	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And as Neil is demonstrating, it's often something a bit silly or crazy. Oh, and happy birthday by the way.
51111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Younger every year. Now, lolz is a close relation of another slang term: LOL.
56333	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>LOL stands for 'laughing out loud'.
59555	We use it when texting or on social media after a joke or something funny.
64333	For example, Neil, your hair looks amazing, LOL.
68333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Why is that a joke? My hair does look great.
72018	Anyway. Lolz can be used in the same way.
75111	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Your hair looks amazing, lolz.
78000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thanks. Or we can use it in the phrase 'for the lolz' as I mentioned earlier.
82600	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Shall we play some examples?
84400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Or I could play my banjo, for the lolz?
89333	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Maybe later! Listen to these examples.
94333	<strong>Examples<br></strong>A: You're putting so many chillies on your pizza? !Why?
98666	<br>B: For the lolz. Going to be hot!
100917	I collect teapots. Everyone tells me it's pointless but I do it for the lolz.
106999	I'm going to convince everyone I'm an astronaut, just for the lolz.
112888	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So - lots of lolz examples there.
116618	So, how long will your hair stay pink, Neil?
119111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's permanent. Unless I dye it again.
121377	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Seriously?
122333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Just kidding. Anyway, Feifei, I've got an idea.
125222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh yeah?
125863	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Why don't you... walk through the office singing Happy Birthday to me?
130444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>But. Why?
131700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>For the lolz, of course!
133400	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Of course.
134444	<strong>Neil</strong><strong> + Feifei<br></strong>Bye.
