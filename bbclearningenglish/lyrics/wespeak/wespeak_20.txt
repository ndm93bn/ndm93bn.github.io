13222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK. Not again. Why oh why is Feifei late for the studio this time? Seriously.
25555	That does it. I'm gonna give her a call.
35666	Great. Let me go out and take a look.
45555	Feifei?! Feifei, where are you?
52153	Where has she gone? Oh, is that.? There she is!
58722	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> Oh, oh, hi, Neil.
60700	<strong>Neil</strong><br> Where have you been? I've been looking <strong>all over the shop</strong> for you!
64082	<strong>Feifei<br></strong><strong>All over the shop</strong>?
65890	Well, I wasn't in a shop. I was in...the toilet!
70666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thanks for the information.
72534	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And yes, before you tell me - I do know what <strong>all over the shop</strong> means. It means 'everywhere'.
78920	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I'm just glad I've found you.
80500	Now we can finally start the programme and explain this expression: <strong>all over the shop</strong>. Oh, we've already done that.
87900	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> Yes. It usually means 'everywhere' - when describing a search for something, or an untidy arrangement of things. Like in these examples:
99845	<strong>Examples<br></strong>Where were you? We looked <strong>all over the shop</strong> for you.
103777	He left his dirty washing <strong>all over the shop</strong>. Our house was a real mess!
109222	I spilled wine <strong>all over the shop</strong> when I tried to open that bottle. Oops.
117322	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>It can also describe someone or something very disorganised. Listen to this:
126555	<strong>Example<br></strong>Sorry, I'm a bit <strong>all over the shop</strong> this morning.
129780	I forgot my ticket, my phone. I left my laptop at home. What's wrong with me?
139227	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So there you go. You can look <strong>all over the shop</strong> for something or someone.
143800	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And you can also leave things <strong>all over the shop</strong> - like the dirty clothes.
147954	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And you yourself can also be <strong>all over the shop</strong> - describing someone who is forgetful or disorganised.
154000	Though not you, of course, Feifei.
155666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Never me.
156600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that is the expression for this programme.
159233	Thank you, Feifei.
160666	Feifei? Feifei? Where's she gone?
166999	Oh, a message.
168623	"Just off to the shops. Need anything?" Very funny.
173773	Bye!
