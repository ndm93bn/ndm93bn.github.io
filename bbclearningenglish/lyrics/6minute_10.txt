339	Introduction...
12179	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14846	I'm Sophie.
15529	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.
16339	Sophie - did you go on the corporate awayday last week?
20547	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes.
21209	you didn't miss anything.
22936	A team building guru lectured us on how to work more effectively with each other.
27310	We gave some presentations, had a few drinks after.
31000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Right.
31662	OK.
32131	An <strong>awayday</strong> is a day that employees spend together away from their usual workplace.
37187	And a <strong>guru</strong> is an expert in something.
39256	So did this guru teach you anything new, Sophie?
42435	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>No.
43053	not really.
43971	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Shame.
44845	I was hoping for some tips on how to work more effectively with my co-presenter.
49240	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I think we work very effectively already, Neil.
52397	Now, today's show is about <strong>team building</strong> - or encouraging employees to work well together as a team by getting them to engage in different types of activities.
63597	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And apparently, some companies in the UK are offering their employees activities such as.
68738	&nbsp;Hunger Games-style combat days where teams must work together to 'kill' as many of the opposing team as possible.
77186	Have you seen the Hunger Games movies, Sophie?
79618	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes.
80066	<strong>Neil<br></strong>There're also Zombie boot camps where military instructors train you on how to fight zombies - that's dead people who have come back to life.
89325	For the more <strong>cerebral</strong> - or brainy - amongst us - there are crime investigations modelled on popular TV dramas like Sherlock Holmes.
97325	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, I'm not sure about the Zombie boot camp - a <strong>boot camp</strong> is a short course of hard physical training - but the Sherlock Holmes awayday sounds like fun.
107031	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I'd definitely go for the Zombie experience.
109655	Though I'm not sure how it connects with most people's working lives.
113538	Violence, death, the living dead.
115522	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Good point.
116439	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So let's move on and have today's quiz question.
119490	What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in1951 as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago?
130156	Was it.
130860	<br>a) calisthenics?
132055	<br>b) calligraphy?
134593	<br>Or c) English language lessons?
137857	<strong>Sophie<br></strong><strong>Calisthenics</strong>, by the way, is a type of gentle physical exercise.
142081	<strong>Neil<br></strong>.
142081	and <strong>calligraphy</strong>, by the way, is the art of writing by hand with a special brush.
146945	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, I'm going for a) calisthenics.
150721	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Not English language lessons, Sophie?
152876	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>No.
153601	I'll stick with callisthenics, thanks.
155649	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK.
156417	Well, we'll find out later if you're right or not.
158508	Now, whilst English lessons might sound like hard work, <em>ukulele</em> lessons are apparently catching on.
164652	A ukulele is a musical instrument.
167382	Top businessmen Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both do it, and stressed-out city workers are following their lead.
173441	Here in the UK, a number of companies have been holding ukulele team building sessions.
178219	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>That sounds amazing.
180054	And is there anything about the ukulele in particular that leaves people feeling better after they've played it?
185857	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Let's hear more about this from Lorraine Bow, who teaches people to play the instrument.
190102	But listen with attention because she spoke on the phone and the line wasn't great.
194262	<strong>INSERT<br>Lorraine Bow, ukulele teacher <br></strong>Well, I guess it's just the fact that you know people don't often sing in their everyday lives and it's the fact that you can play and sing - play a musical instrument - within an hour - it's quite a.
206080	you know.
206592	it's quite a fulfilling thing really.
208512	It's not competitive - it's quite easy to do and a bit less intimidating than a guitar.
212672	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Lorraine, the ukulele teacher, also says her classes aren't competitive or <strong>intimidating</strong>.
219797	<strong>Neil<br></strong>.
219797	which means something that makes you feel nervous.
222336	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Now, before we hear the answer to today's quiz question, let's hear about a company in Abu Dhabi where leadership is taught through horse training.
231616	Basically, you have to go in the yard with a horse and persuade it that you're the boss by using body language.
239104	Here's Kelly Eide, co-founder of the company, explaining why she thinks this approach works.
245845	<strong>INSERT<br>Kelly Eide, Co-founder of True Leadership, Abu Dhabi<br></strong>The horses don't care if your hair is purple, if you're a man or a woman, if you're old or young, if you are.
254762	what religion.
255936	So it transcends all of those cultural boundaries - it transcends age, gender, religion, tradition etc.
263381	- so that's a perfect fit.
266517	And in an organization where you really need groups of people to gel, who come from backgrounds which have no common norms, you can teach that most efficiently with a horse.
279551	<strong>Neil <br></strong>To <strong>gel</strong> with someone means to connect or get on well with someone.
285546	So you try and get the horse to do what you want using body language.
289279	And the horse feels instinctively whether or not you are a natural leader because it doesn't recognize cultural differences, hair colour and age.
297066	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Probably easier said than done.
298857	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Indeed.
299519	Now remember I asked: What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in1951 as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago?
310719	&nbsp; Was it.
311124	a) calisthenics?
312383	b) calligraphy?
314367	Or c) English language lessons?
316585	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I said a) calisthenics.
318740	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, you're right on the button!
321470	Well done there, Sophie!
322409	Calisthenics are used at schools as a warm up for physical education classes, during sports day activities, and by some companies as a way of building morale and a sense of group unity, as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health.
337108	Now <strong>shake a leg</strong> - or in other words - get moving - and tell us the words we learned today, Sophie.
343891	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>They are:<br>awayday<br>guru<br>team building<br>cerebral<br>bootcamp<br>callisthenics<br>calligraphy<br>synchronise<br>intimidating<br>gel<br>shake a leg
364222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's the end of this 6 Minute English.
366760	We hope you enjoyed it.
367656	And don't forget to join us again soon!
369470	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.
