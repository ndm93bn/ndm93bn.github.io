1	(Introduction...)
7011	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Hello and welcome to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.
21818	Mary's a new student who has just arrived at the University of Studies and now after settling in, her studying can finally begin.
31958	Mary, it's time for your first lecture - but you look like <strong>a bundle of nerves</strong>.
37252	<strong>Mary<br></strong>... well I am a bit <strong>nervous</strong>, I couldn't sleep last night.
41800	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Don't worry, you're not alone - everyone's in the same position. Everything will be fine - good luck!
47516	<strong>Mary<br></strong>OK, well it's time to go in.
51248	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Ah Mary - we meet again. How's your head today?
56165	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Better thanks - I see you managed to err... clean your shoes.
61871	<strong>Prof. Not<br> </strong>Yes, I did - they still smell a bit but I'll survive.
65815	Shall we get down to business - Business Studies - now that <em>most</em> of us are here?
71953	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Yes, of course.
73232	<strong>Daniel<br> </strong>Oh... err... sorry I'm late. I went to the wrong room.
78108	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Hmmm. the first rule of business is punctuality.
82399	As T.C.Haliburton once said "Punctuality is the soul of business."
89076	Now, what is business and why do we study it? Business is an economic system.
96340	A company transacts business activities.
99381	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Daniel, what's he talking about?
102089	<strong>Daniel</strong><br> Haven't a clue... have you got a spare pen by the way?
105459	Look, you're going to have to ask him to explain.
109074	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Me!?
109709	<strong>Prof. Not</strong><br> What was that Mary?
110718	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Oh, nothing. Sorry.
112438	<strong>Narrator<br> </strong>I think Daniel's <strong>a nervous wreck</strong> - he's not going to help you so I will!
117288	If something doesn't make sense, put your hand up and say 'excuse me, could you say that again please?'
123319	or 'I don't understand, can you explain that again please?'
126957	- or maybe 'could you explain that in a different way please?'
130467	<strong>Mary<br></strong>OK.
131917	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Errr, yes Mary, what is it?
135350	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Prof. Not... it's all very interesting but could you say that again please?
142307	Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.
144910	<strong>Prof. Not</strong><br> Oh!
145363	<strong>Mary</strong><br> I'd appreciate it if you could explain it in a different way... please?
150881	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>I think what Professor Not means is you have to have a soul to be in business.
157224	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>No. Daniel isn't it? What I mean is.
166721	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Daniel's <strong>got a nerve</strong>, pretending he knows it all - perhaps it's just <strong>nervous energy</strong> that makes him such an idiot!
174163	Anyway, well done Mary - you spoke up and asked for clarification. It's a good idea to ask if you don't understand something.
181991	Don't pretend you know something when you don't - like Daniel did! Here's a reminder of the questions Mary asked.
189342	<strong>Could you say that again please?</strong>
192252	<strong>Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.</strong>
195558	<strong>Could you explain that in a different way please?</strong>

209064	Now, the lecture is over, I wonder if things are a bit clearer for Mary?
213970	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Thanks Professor. Everything's much clearer now.
218657	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Well I recommend you get my book from the library - 'Mind Your Own Business' - oh and Mary.
225654	I hold a seminar every Monday at the local pub should you wish to join us sometime?
231239	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Yes Professor... thanks, I will.
234515	<strong>Prof. Not</strong><br> You can call me Robert.
236057	<strong>Daniel</strong><br> Ok Robert! It's a date!
237960	<strong>Prof. Not</strong><br> Oh, it's you.
239001	Well, don't forget to bring your notes.
241082	<strong>Daniel</strong><br> Oh no, my notes! I left them in the classroom.
