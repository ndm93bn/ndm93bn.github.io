1	(Introduction...)
5706	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Hello. Welcome back to English at University â€“ &nbsp;the series that follows Mary through her first year of study abroad and teaches her and us some useful phrases.
22189	It's the second term and students at the University of Studies settle down to some hard work.
28009	Mary's in a lecture, struggling to write down everything that Professor Not is trying to sayâ€¦
35675	<strong>Prof. Not</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> â€¦so this term, we're doing the module on marketing.
38642	Business and marketing go hand-in-hand.
41243	Any business in a marketplace is likely to be in competition with other firms offering similar productsâ€¦
48228	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Errâ€¦ excuse me Professorâ€¦ could you say that again please?
52982	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>â€¦ I saidâ€¦ any business in a marketplaceâ€¦
55440	<strong>Mary</strong><br> No the bit before thatâ€¦ please. You're going a bit too fast for me.
60543	<strong>Narrator<br> </strong>Having trouble Mary?
61946	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes. I'm trying to write down everything he says but I can't keep up.
66015	<strong>Narrator<br> </strong>You can't write <em>everything</em> down â€“ you need to take notes.
70005	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Notes?
70990	<strong>Narrator<br> </strong>Just <strong>note down</strong> words, phrases, bits of information from the lecture â€“ things that will help you remember what's been said.
78345	Ask for help if you're not sure what to do.
80764	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, I think I will.
83121	Ermm, Professorâ€¦ sorry to interrupt againâ€¦ what you're saying is fascinatingâ€¦ but I want to remember it allâ€¦ have you any guidance about how to take notes?
95107	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Oh thank you Mary. Fascinating eh?
98061	Well just use a pen and a notebookâ€¦
101384	<strong>Mary<br></strong>But what should I write down?
103432	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>I think you need one of theseâ€¦ a voice recorderâ€¦ just record the whole thing, listen back to it later. Easy!
110147	<strong>Prof. Not</strong><br> Is it? Well, writing things down is probably more useful.
114052	It gives you a chance to ask for clarification.
117056	Now Mary, just <strong>jot down</strong> the important bitsâ€¦ I'll emphasise these bits in the lecture.
122560	I'll say something like 'this bit is useful to knowâ€¦'.
125775	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>You won't need to write much then!
127377	What? It was a joke!
129775	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Hmm. Yes, well.
133054	Now, write down what I say in your own words â€“ although if I quote someone, make sure you write it down <strong>word-for-word</strong>.
140461	And use words, abbreviations, symbols or even pictures to summarise what I say.
146526	If you miss something, leave a gap in your notes, and get the information from me later. Does that help?
152338	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Perfectly.
153571	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Remember to read through your notes after the lecture, and of course, anything you do miss you can find in my new book 'Funny Business'.
165790	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>That's been a useful lesson, hasn't it Mary? Note taking is an important skill to learn.
171329	If you're not sure where to start, ask for help using these phrasesâ€¦
175045	<strong>Could you say that again please?
177530	<strong>You're going a bit too fast for me.
179641	<strong>Have you any guidance about how to take notes?
182965	And here's Professor Not's tips for taking notesâ€¦
186898	<strong>Write down the important bitsâ€¦ I'll emphasise these bits in the lecture.

218504	Now, let's find out how the note taking's goingâ€¦
221722	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>So that's all for todayâ€¦ must dash, I've got a yoga class to go to.
226520	We can discuss this further in your tutorial.
230631	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Oh no! Oh, I don't believe it.
233709	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Problem Daniel?
234886	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>The batteries on my voice recorder have run outâ€¦ so annoyingâ€¦ I don't supposeâ€¦
241009	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, you can copy my notes.
243351	<strong>Daniel<br> </strong>Great. And maybe I could buy you a drink to say thank you.
247062	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Maybe, Daniel.
