6091	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Welcome back to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year at university.
19543	Mary's trying to get hold of her assignment which is saved on Daniel's memory stick â€“ it was in his trouser pocket.
26239	Not anymore and the hunt is now on to find it.
32103	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Now I put it in my pocket here and walked over there and through the doorâ€¦
37129	<strong>Mary<br></strong>You should be more careful. Goodness you've got stuff <strong>all</strong> <strong>over the place</strong>!
42610	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>It may look <strong>chaotic</strong> but I'm sure it's here somewhere. It's got my name on it.
47110	Oh it's no good - you'll have to go to the lost property office and see if it's in there.
52095	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Me?
52816	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Well I'll carry on looking for it in here.
54939	Just go down the corridor, turn left and then right, the office is behind the student union.
60620	Just tell them 'I've lost a memory stick' or something.
62839	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh, ok. See you later.
66752	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Err Mary â€“ don't be too <strong>hasty</strong>.
70141	You can't just say 'I've lost a memory stick' or something â€“ he hasn't got a clue!
74652	When you get to the lost property office, just say 'I wonder if you can help me please?
79345	I'm looking for a memory stick that I lost earlier.'
82158	And 'has anyone handed in a memory stick today?'
85501	<strong>Mary<br></strong>And if they haven't got it?
87217	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Say that you would like them to let you know if gets handed in.
91311	Give them your details and hopefully it will turn up â€“ it'll be found. Look you're here nowâ€¦
97271	<strong>Mary<br></strong>OK thanks.
100433	<strong>Caretaker<br></strong>Yes?
101726	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Err, hello. I'veâ€¦ lost something.
106425	<strong>Caretaker<br></strong>Goodâ€¦ I mean, good you're in the right place â€“ the LOST property office.
111539	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Right...Good...Well. I wonder if you can help me please?
117385	Earlier today Iâ€¦ well, my friendâ€¦ lost a memory stick somewhere on the university campus.
124041	<strong>Caretaker<br></strong>Memory stick? We've got thousands of those.
126760	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh I see.
128623	I wonderâ€¦ has anyone handed in <em>my</em> memory stickâ€¦ a black one, with the name Daniel Smythe written on it?
137634	It's very precious to me.
139549	<strong>Caretaker<br></strong>What, the memory stick or Daniel Smythe?!
142692	Look, I'll see what we've got. Nope, nothing there. Sorry.
150626	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh no. Well, if somebody hands it in, please can you let me know?
155586	Here are my contact details.
159210	<strong>Caretaker<br></strong>Alright but I don't think there's much chance of it turning up.
165524	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear Mary. Things aren't looking good.
168460	Daniel's organisational skills seem a bit <strong>haphazard</strong>.
171744	In future, don't trust Daniel with anything valuable.
175344	Anyway, you've done your best trying to find that memory stick by using these phrasesâ€¦

202346	Never mind Mary, I'm sure it will turn up â€“ but now it's time to do some washing at the laundretteâ€¦
208422	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>I've searched everywhere and I just don't know what's happened to itâ€¦ anyway how do you use these stupid washing machines?
215675	<strong>Mary<br></strong>The clothes go in thereâ€¦ the money goes in thereâ€¦ and the powder goes there.
222133	Is this the first wash you've done this term?
225202	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>It's the first wash I've ever done - my mum usually does my washing.
229184	Hold on, what's this at the bottom? The memory stick!
234481	It was wrapped up in with my dirty pants!
237424	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yuk! You'd better get those in the machine and I'll get that to Professor Not as soon as possible.
244821	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Crisis averted!
