33557	<strong>Abi<br></strong>â€¦some of thatâ€¦ and some of thatâ€¦ ooo, and a bit of thatâ€¦
39355	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Gosh, that's a lot of food Abi.
42101	<strong>Abi</strong><br> Yeah but you can eat as much as you like here â€“ it's the same price â€“ so go on, <strong>fill your boots</strong>!
50095	I'll see you over at the table.

69291	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Don't worry.
70104	Before you <strong>tuck in to</strong> a vegetarian meal, just ask 'can you tell me which food is suitable for vegetarians?'
77644	or 'has this got meat in it?'
79861	and then when you want to find stuff like the cutlery â€“ the knives and forks â€“ just ask 'where can I can findâ€¦' or 'do you have anyâ€¦?'
88032	Go on give it a go.

219409	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>So sorry about thatâ€¦ if I just scrape this bit offâ€¦ err you'll be fine.
225726	<strong>Prof.Not<br> </strong>So what was your 'business idea'? Dry cleaning perhaps?
