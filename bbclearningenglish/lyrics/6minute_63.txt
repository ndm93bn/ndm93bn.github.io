1	(Introduction...)
12777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello, I'm Rob. Welcome to Six Minute English, where we discuss an interesting topic and a zillion items of vocabulary.
19777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hi, I'm Catherine. Er... Rob? We aren't going to discuss a zillion items of vocabulary - we're going to discuss six Rob. We've got six minutes.
28844	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, I just wanted to introduce the word zillion because that's what we're talking about today!
33600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>A <strong>zillion</strong> means a very big number.
37333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But when we talk about a zillion things we don't mean an exact number - just a very big one.
42444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Did you know Rob that numbers like zillion are called 'indefinite hyperbolic numerals'.
49555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Really?
50444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Indefinite</strong> means vague or without clear limits, and <strong>numeral</strong> is another word for number.
57151	But can you tell me what 'hyperbolic' means? Is it. <br>a) endless,<br>b) enormous or<br>c) exaggerated?
67329	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I'm going to say... endless. Can you give us another example of an indefinite... hyperbolic numeral pleaseCatherine?
75733	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I tell you what - why don't we listen to an expert in the field to find out more.
80659	Stephen Chrisomalis is a Linguistic Anthropologist at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.
87777	And he knows a lot about numbers! See if you can spot a few hyperbolic numerals, Rob!
94444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK.
95156	<strong>Stephen Chrisomalis, Linguistic Anthropologist, Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan<br></strong>The smallest indefinite hyperbolic numerals are words like umpteen and umpty and umptisteen and fortyleven, and these are big, indefinite, but we still have a sense that these are quite small because of the morphemes -ty and -teen.
116333	Then above that you have the numerals like zillion and jillion and squillion, and those are clearly bigger than a million because most of us know what a million is, and we know that everything less than a million has...you know...has some different form.
132222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK - I heard umpteen and umpty, which end in the morphemes -teen and -ty - like fifteen and fifty. Then there were two more I didn't catch.
142874	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>A <strong>morpheme</strong> is the smallest unit of meaning in a language, for example, a word or part of a word.
150333	So you didn't catch umptisteen or fortyleven?
154888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hmm. No. I'm not familiar with umpti..steen and forty-whatsit.
159999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But let's get back to what Stephen Chrisomalis was saying.
164222	The ending -illion tells us a number is big - because we recognize it from real numbers like million and billion.
171777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So when we put a funny morpheme at the front - to make zillion, jillion, or squillion - we understand that the number is probably more than a million.
179962	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now do people use big indefinite numbers anywhere else in the world, Rob?
185444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Sure. In the Middle East, a thousand and one is used as a big indefinite number - like in the famous storybook, <em>A Thousand and One Nights</em>.
193777	In Japan they use eight thousand. And in Sweden they say <em>femtioelva</em> - which means fiftyleven.
200699	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But it still sounds like here in the UK we use sillier numerals than in other parts of the world.
206700	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's true. And it gets even sillier when we start using <strong>intensifiers</strong> - these are words - or prefixes in this case - that make the meaning of another word stronger.
216444	Let's listen to our expert in the field again, talking about this.
220222	<strong>Stephen Chrisomalis, Linguistic Anthropologist, Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan<br></strong>The intensifiers are ka and ga and ba. So if I were to ask, which is bigger, a zillion or a bazillion?
228515	Almost all English speakers will say that a bazillion is definitely bigger than a zillion.
233666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK - well we haven't got a gazillion minutes to finish the show - but I should explain that a <strong>prefix</strong> is a letter or letters added to the beginning of the word to change its meaning.
244943	Now, let's move on to today's question. Rob, I asked you: What does 'hyperbolic' mean?
251578	Is it.<br>a) endless,<br>b) enormous or<br>c) exaggerated?
257555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I said endless.
259111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And you were wrong again I'm afraid Rob! The answer is c) exaggerated.
265222	It has a more specific meaning in mathematics, but the origin of the word is the same. The noun hyperbole comes from Ancient Greek.
274510	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, let's use some hyperbole to talk through the vocabulary items we heard today.
279333	Number one is 'zillion' - which means a very big but indefinite number. For example, 'I have a zillion things to do today.'
287444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, number two - 'indefinite' means vague or without clear limits.
292555	For example, 'Rob will be on holiday for an indefinite period of time.'
297488	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Really? Who told you that?
298917	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's move on to number three! Numeral - or number.
303222	For example, 'The letter X is the Roman numeral for ten.'
307333	Number four - a morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language, for example, a word or part of a word.
315893	<strong>Rob<br></strong>For example, 'Gazillion' contains two morphemes - ga and zillion.'
321888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number five - an 'intensifier' makes the meaning of another word stronger.
326838	'Rob made me an excellent cup of coffee this morning.'
330777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Did I? The intensifier in this example is 'excellent'.
335222	I'm glad you like my coffee, Catherine!
337999	OK, our final word today is 'prefix' - which is a letter or letters added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning.
344999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>For example, '<em>Un</em> is a very common prefix in the English language.'
349600	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Unquestionably! Well, that's all we have time for today. But if you would like to befriend us - that's be-friend with the prefix 'be' + the noun 'friend'.

366888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Not umpteen, Catherine! Squillions! Gazillions, in fact! Bye.
371288	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Bye!
