11859	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14590	I'm Aliceâ€¦
15550	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neilâ€¦ Umâ€¦ Alice.
18153	What's this?
18857	<strong>Alice<br></strong>It's a cup of tea, Neil.
20627	Would you like some?
21459	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, I can't drink that!
22376	You didn't let the tea brew for long enough.
24638	And you forgot to add sugar.
26536	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, make it yourself next time!
28456	And when you <strong>brew</strong> a cup of tea, by the way, you add boiling water to tea leaves or a teabag and allow the flavour to develop.
37032	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I'm sorry, Alice.
37715	I didn't mean to be rude about your tea.
39315	But I do like it very strong and sweet.
41448	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Tea is the subject of today's show.
43773	And Neil, I think you'd like the way they serve tea in India.
47784	They drink <em>chai </em>- a strong black tea served with lots of milk, sugar and spices.
53309	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Mmmâ€¦ that does sound good.
55016	I quite fancy a cup of <em>chai</em> now.
56723	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Did you know that it was the British who introduced tea to India?
61139	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, I didn't, Alice.
62035	This is very interestingâ€¦ I'm proud of our habit of having tea all the time and teabags are great!
67602	A marvellous little invention!
69010	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, I agree.
70376	Well, that's my question for you today.
72765	Where was the teabag invented?
75645	Was it in â€¦<br>a) China<br>b) the US<br>Or c) Britain
81746	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hmm.
82194	I buy a lot of teabags but I don't know their history.
85778	So I'm going to guess c) Britain.
88679	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on.
92178	Let's listen now to Professor Markman Ellis talking about the Chinese tea plant.
97511	He's a historian at Queen Mary, University of London.
100711	<strong>INSERT<br>Professor Markman Ellis, historian, Queen Mary, University of London<br></strong>Tea is a shrub that grows naturally in the mountainous areas of China and several thousand years ago, no one knows how exactly, thereâ€¦ I meanâ€¦ there are storiesâ€¦ it became clear that if you consumed the leaves of this plant especially the younger leaves, then it had an interesting effect on you.
118290	And that effect could be thought of as medicinal or it could be thought of as just kind of sanative - making you feel a bit better than you used to feel.
126268	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Professor Markman Ellis tells us that people in Ancient China <strong>consumed</strong> - or ate - leaves from the tea plant and it had an interesting effect on them.
135484	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Professor Ellis says tea has a <strong>sanative</strong> effect - making you feel better - so I might try munching a few leaves later on.
142823	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Alright then.
143825	Apparently the Chinese started drinking tea because of its <strong>medicinal</strong> - or healing - qualities.
149628	And they've been drinking tea for thousands of years!
152764	Well we British may love a good cup of tea - but we haven't been brewing it for nearly so long as the Chinese.
158417	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But remember that tea actually grows in China, Alice.
161980	We don't grow it in Britain.
163196	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Good point, Neil.
164070	Which brings me back to what we were talking about earlier.
167569	In the 19th century the British started to grow tea in India in order to compete with Chinese tea production.
173862	When tea first arrived in Britain in the 17th century it was incredibly expensive and only the elite could afford to drink it.
181713	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Elite</strong> means a small group of people in society who have money and power.
185851	Well, the opposite is true today - everyone drinks tea!
188710	And cheap teabags make really strong tea - just the way I like it!
192720	<strong>Alice<br></strong>[noise of disgust] Oh, it's not for me!
194470	I like tea with a delicate flavour - Lapsang Suchong is my favourite with its evocative fragrance.
201062	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Not teabags, then?
202662	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No, Neil.
203579	Lapsang is different from other types of tea because the leaves are smoke-dried over pinewood fires giving the tea its distinctive smoky flavour.
212838	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You sound like a TV advert - I can just see the misty mountains and fields of teaâ€¦ Can you tell us what <strong>evocative</strong> means?
221733	<strong>Alice<br></strong>It means making you imagine something pleasant.
224741	And for some people tea drinking is a spiritual experience.
228944	Let's listen to BBC reporter Mike Williams learning about the Asian custom of the tea ceremony.
234853	<strong>INSERT<br>Mike Williams and his Chinese host<br></strong><strong>CH:</strong> Please enjoy a mouthful of green tea.
240549	<br><strong>MW:</strong> Thank you.
241424	That was a bit less than a mouthful.
246522	It's a very very small amount, isn't it?
248080	<br><strong>CH:</strong> It's about 20ml.
249146	It's the way to appreciate tea in very small quantities so you can concentrate and cultivate your mindfulness in drinking the tea.
256357	<br><strong>MW:</strong> Mindfulness?
258597	What do you mean by mindfulness?
261541	<br><strong>CH:</strong> Tea ceremony has some of its origin in Buddhism.
264847	The Japanese tea ceremony for example has a lot of Zen Buddhism influence.
269370	Mindfulness is the concentration and focus on the now - forget about the past, forget about the future, and enjoy this specific moment.
279631	And that's what I call mindfulness.
281338	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So they don't use mugs in the tea ceremony.
285263	It's 20 millilitres or a mouthful of green tea.
288676	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's right.
289743	Drinking just a <strong>mouthful</strong> - or a small amount - helps you concentrate and cultivate mindfulness.
295844	As the speaker explains, <strong>mindfulness</strong> means living in the moment and forgetting about the past and future.
302457	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, forgive me for thinking about the past - but how about the answer to today's quiz question?
307492	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK then.
308324	I asked: Where was the teabag invented?
311780	Was it inâ€¦ a) China?
314447	, b) the US?
316281	of&nbsp;c) Britain?
318244	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said c) Britain.
320206	And I must be right.
320932	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, I'm afraid you're wrong, Neil!
325476	It was b) the US.
328441	Teabags first appeared commercially in the first decade of the 20th century and were successfully marketed by Thomas Sullivan, a tea merchant from New York, who shipped his teabags around the world.
340281	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Really?
340900	Teabags are older than I thought!
343011	Now, can you tell us the words we heard today?
346467	<strong>Alice<br></strong>They are:<br>brew<br>consumed<br>sanative<br>medicinal<br>elite<br>evocative<br>mouthful<br>mindfulness
361955	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
365112	You can go and put the kettle on now for a nice brew.
367374	Please join us again soon!
368696	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.
