20627	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Hello! And welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Neilâ€¦
24408	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>â€¦ and me Catherine. Today weâ€™re talking about how to pronounce words that begin with the letter c.
30571	<strong>Neil</strong><br>We'll look at lots of examplesâ€¦
32297	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>â€¦we'll give you a quiz and we'll leave you with a top tip for remembering new&nbsp;English words.
38921	<strong>Neil</strong><br>So, to start off, let's listen to Maria. She works in a circus â€“ do you like circuses Catherine?
44638	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>When I was a kid I think I wanted to join a circus.
48098	These days I'm not so sure. Performing animals not my thing really.
51817	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Well Maria is a circus performer - she's not an animal - and we're going to hear her talking about how she started in the job.
59309	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And here's a question to think about while you listen:
61900	<strong>Neil</strong><br>What didn't Maria do at weekends? Here she is.
66525	<strong>Maria</strong><br>I started performing in my family's circus when I was nine years old. I loved it.
73573	At the weekends, me and my sisters didn't go to cybercafes or the cinema or hang around the park smoking cigarettes like other teenagers.
84927	We practised performing. I celebrated my 16th birthday by learning to ride a cycle that was only 20 centimetres high!
95816	My brother's bike was so high it reached the ceiling!
101134	<strong>STING</strong>
104122	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So Maria had an interesting childhood, didn't she?!
107003	And we asked you: what didn't she do at weekends?
110703	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is: She didn't go to the park or the cinema like other kids.
116611	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>No. She practised performing.
118678	And cinema is an important word in the show today because we spell it with a letter c, but we pronounce it with a /s/ sound.
128142	We don't say 'kinema', itâ€™s cinema.
132007	A lot of words that start with the letter c are pronounced with a /k/ sound, like cakeâ€¦ crime, count, my name Catherine, card, lots of themâ€¦
142594	<strong>Neil</strong><br>But most words that start with the letters c-i are pronounced with a /s/ sound.
148934	Words like cinema, cigarette, and circus. And that's rule one. Listen again.
155079	<strong>Maria</strong><br>I started performing in my familyâ€™s circus when I was nine years old.
161181	I loved it. At the weekends, me and my sisters didn't go to cybercafes or the cinema or hang around the park smoking cigarettes like other teenagers.
173910	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Good. Now let's see how we pronounce words that start with the letters c-e.
179677	Listen to this clip and see if you can spot those words.
183319	<strong>Maria</strong><br>I celebrated my 16th birthday by learning to ride a cycle that was only 20 centimetres high!
191289	My brother's bike was so high it reached the ceiling!
196851	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So we had three c-e words there: all pronounced with a /s/ sound.
203525	We had celebrate, centimetre and ceiling. That's our second rule.
209378	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And perhaps you spotted our third rule in that last clipâ€¦
212862	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Yes, well done if you've already noticed that words like cycle and cybercafĂ© are pronounced with a /s/ sound even though they are spelt with c-y.
223619	Here's the whole clip again.
226130	<strong>Maria</strong><br>I started performing in my family's circus when I was nine years old.
232266	I loved it. At the weekends, me and my sisters didn't go to cybercafes or the cinema or hang around the park smoking cigarettes like other teenagers.
245126	We practised performing. I celebrated my 16th birthday by learning to ride a cycle that was only 20 centimetres high!
255934	My brother's bike was so high it reached the ceiling!
261520	<strong>IDENT</strong><br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
268340	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And we're talking about how to spell words that begin with the /s/ sound.
273697	When a word starts with the letters c-e, c-i or c-y, we usually pronounce it with a /s/ sound.
283223	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Right, it's quiz time! How many words in these sentences are spelt with the letter c at the beginning?
292095	Number one, listen carefully. I can't see my cycle anywhere.
299265	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And there were two words with c at the beginning â€“ can't and cycle.
304762	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Excellent! Number two: Christopher has gone to the cinema but Colin is coming to the cybercafĂ©.
312748	<strong>Neil</strong><br>There were five that time: Christopher, cinema, Colin, coming, cybercafĂ©.
324003	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>OK. And get ready for number three: Crazy coloured circus clowns create chaos in cinema circles.
333099	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And that was a whopping eight words beginning with the letter c.
337840	Crazy, coloured, circus, clowns, create, chaos, cinema, circles.
345932	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And congratulations if you got them all right! That's the end of the quiz.
350811	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And here's a top tip to help you with new vocabulary.
