12800	<strong>Catherine</strong>  <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherineâ€¦
16555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And I'm Finn. Now make sure you pay <strong>attention</strong> because we have a lot of <strong>information</strong>â€¦
25666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's rightâ€¦ and <strong>attention </strong>and <strong>information</strong> are a good <strong>introduction</strong> to the programme.
31477	<strong>Finn<br></strong>They are. They both end in<strong> 'shun'</strong> /Êƒ(É™)n/, which is the suffix we're talking about.
36600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Suffixes are groups of letters at the end of words which can change the form or meaning of a word, or both.
44777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we'll tell you about the three different ways to spell the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>.
50000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we'll give you examples of words with all three spellings, plus some tips for knowing which spelling to useâ€¦
56999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We'll have a quizâ€¦
58558	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and we'll finish with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
61600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But first, let's hear a news report about the theft of a valuable statue.
67111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Where was the statue from? Hereâ€™s the report.
74056	<strong>INSERT<br></strong>A man was charged today following an <strong>investigation </strong>into the theft of valuable objects from the museum.
79794	The man confessed after witnesses came forward with <strong>information</strong> and his <strong>description </strong>appeared in the newspapers.
86400	In his <strong>confession</strong>,he said that he had gained<strong> admission </strong>to the museum by pretending to be a security guard.
92330	Police recovered items including a priceless <strong>Venetian</strong> vase and an <strong>Egyptian</strong> statue.
98777	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So, we asked you: Where was the statue from?
102444	<strong>Finn</strong><br>And the answer is: Egypt. It was <strong>Egyptian</strong>.
106400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. And the word <strong>Egyptian </strong>has the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-a</strong>-<strong>n</strong>.
114223	And we usually find this spelling in adjectives that describe where something or someone comes from.
121222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, the stolen <strong>Egyptian</strong> statue came from Egyptâ€¦
125333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly, and the <strong>Venetian </strong>vase came from <strong>Venice</strong>.
129555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In these examples, the suffix <strong>'shun', </strong>spelt<strong> t-i-a-n,</strong> turns the noun into an adjective; and these adjectives are often written with a capital letter because they come from proper nouns.
142400	Now, another example is <strong>Martian -</strong>&nbsp;and Martians come from <strong>Mars</strong>!
147500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I suppose they do. Let's listen to another clip with more words that end in<strong> 'shun'</strong>. See if you can spot them.
154508	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>A man was charged today following an <strong>investigation </strong>into the theft of valuable objects from the museum.
160108	The man confessed after witnesses came forward with <strong>information</strong> and his <strong>description </strong>appeared in the newspapers.
166666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we had three words ending in&nbsp;<strong>'shun'</strong> - <strong>investigation</strong>, <strong>description</strong>â€¦
172800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and <strong>information</strong>.
174333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now here, the<strong> 'shun' </strong>at the end is spelt<strong> t-i-o-n</strong>.
178444	This is the most usual spelling for <strong>'shun'</strong>.
181135	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And words with <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-o-n</strong> are nouns. They usually come from verbs.
188590	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So the word <strong>investigation</strong> comes from the verb <strong>investigate</strong>â€¦ the word <strong>description</strong> comes from <strong>describe</strong>â€¦
195600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and the word <strong>information</strong> comes from the verb <strong>inform</strong>.
199000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>There are many words with this spelling of <strong>'shun'</strong>.
201777	We told you to pay <strong>attention</strong> at the start of the programmeâ€¦
205111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yep and there are other words like <strong>addition</strong>,<strong> subtraction</strong>,<strong> accommodation</strong>,<strong> population</strong>â€¦
210111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Many, many more. So thatâ€™s words with the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>t-i-o-n </strong>and <strong>t-i-a-n</strong>.
217777	Now let's look at the third spelling of the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>: <strong>s-i-o-n</strong>.
222911	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And here they are in another clip.
224960	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>In his <strong>confession</strong>,he said thathe had gained<strong> admission </strong>to the museum by pretending to be a security guard.
230800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we had<strong> confession </strong>and<strong> admission.
234000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, nouns with the ending <strong>'shun'</strong> spelt <strong>s-i-o-n</strong> are often based on words ending in&nbsp;double <strong>-s</strong> or -<strong>m-i-t</strong> like <strong>confession</strong> from <strong>confess</strong>.
246400	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>E</strong><strong>xpression</strong> from <strong>express</strong>â€¦
249000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ <strong>discussion</strong> from <strong>discuss</strong>â€¦
251269	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦<strong>admission</strong> from <strong>admitâ€¦</strong>
253495	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and <strong>permission </strong>from <strong>permit</strong>.
256284	<strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp; <br>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
262505	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about the suffix <strong>'shun'</strong>. We can spell it in three different waysâ€¦
268500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>There's <strong>t-i-a-n</strong>, as in <strong>Egyptian</strong> or <strong>Venetian.
272700	These are adjectives which indicate someone or something's origin.
276600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or we can spell it <strong>s-i-o-n</strong>. And these words are nouns and are often based on verbs ending in -<strong>s-s</strong>, like <strong>discussion</strong> from <strong>discuss</strong>.
286488	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦or verbs ending in<strong> -t </strong>like <strong>permission</strong> from <strong>permit</strong>.
290800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And finally, the most common spelling <strong>t-i-o-n</strong>, as in nouns like<strong> information</strong> and <strong>ambition</strong>.
297555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh, ambition, yeah. Catherine, do you have a secret <strong>ambition</strong>?
301444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I have an ambition. It's not so secret but I would love to go to Africa on a safari. What about you, Finn?
307888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh, yes, travel as well. Iâ€™d love to travel through South America one day.
312400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I hope you get to do it.
314015	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thank you.
314666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Quite soon. Now, time for a quiz. What is the correct spelling for the ending of these words. Is it<strong> t-i-o-n, s-i-o-n, </strong>or<strong> t-i-a-n? </strong> Ready?
