1	(Introduction...)
13822	<strong>Neil</strong>  <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary.I'm Neil.
17166	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And I'm Catherine. In this programme we're looking at multi-word verbs like <strong>move in, move on, move out </strong>and<strong> get on</strong>, and we call these <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>.
33875	And prepositions like <strong>in,</strong> <strong>on,</strong> or <strong>out</strong> can completely change the meaning of phrasal verbs.
42294	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...so we'll be looking at these verbs in sentences to help us understand their meanings.
48006	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Let's start by listening to Robin.
50487	Heâ€™s having problems with his housemate, Pete.
53080	And here's a question for you while you listen. Why is Robin unhappy with Pete?
58591	<strong>INSERT<br>Robin<br></strong>Pete <strong>moved in</strong> three months ago.
61081	We <strong>got on</strong> well at first â€“ we were friends â€“ but now it's terrible.
65676	He's so messy! And he keeps disturbing me when I'm trying to <strong>get on with</strong> my college work.
71267	It's really time for us to <strong>move on</strong> â€“ we can't be friends anymore.
75073	I'm going to ask him to <strong>move out</strong> and live somewhere else, but he <strong>gets on with</strong> my family â€“ my brother really likes him â€“ so it'll be difficult.
85394	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK. So we asked you: why is Robin unhappy with Pete?
90650	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>It's because Pete is messy and keeps disturbing him. What do you think of that, Neil?
95706	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I'm not surprised then.
96960	They were friends at first. Here's what Robin said:
100404	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1 <br></strong>We <strong>got on</strong> well at first â€“ we were friends.
103828	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Right. So, here, <strong>get on</strong> means <strong>have a good relationship</strong>.
108232	And we can work out the meaning of <strong>get on</strong> by listening to what Robin said next.
113128	He said: <strong>we were friends</strong>.
115309	<strong>Neil</strong><br>What about Pete's relationship with Robinâ€™s family?
118377	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>...he <strong>gets on with</strong> my family â€“ my brother really likes him.
122054	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So Pete and Robin's family have a good relationship.
125704	And to add an object to the verb get on, we use the preposition <strong>with</strong>.
131266	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. We can say: Pete and Robin's family <strong>get on</strong>.
135563	And we can also say: Pete <strong>gets on with</strong> Robin's family.
139624	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We can. Now listen to <strong>get on</strong> in this clip.
143168	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3 <br></strong>...and he keeps disturbing me when I'm trying to <strong>get on with</strong> my college work.
147298	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>This time,<strong> get on with</strong> isn't about a relationship.
151157	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>No, it isn't. In this one, <strong>get on with</strong> means <strong>do</strong>, or <strong>continue doing</strong>, something.
158096	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But Robin can't <strong>get on with it</strong> because Pete keeps disturbing him.
162641	Pete stops Robin finishing his work.
165409	And to understand what <strong>get on with</strong> means in each of these contexts, we have to pay attention to the words around each verb phrase.
173608	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We do. So, <strong>get on with</strong> usually means <strong>have a good relationship</strong> when the sentence around it is talking about people.
183412	<strong>Neil</strong><br><strong>Get on with</strong> is usually about finishing something if we're talking about work, studies or a project.
189791	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary, from BBC Learning English.
198244	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And we're talking about <strong>phrasal verbs</strong>.
201092	We've looked at <strong>get on </strong>and<strong> get on with</strong> to talk about relationships.
205135	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>My brother and sister don't <strong>get on</strong>, but I <strong>get on with</strong> both of them.
210057	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, lucky you.
210867	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I know.
211396	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>get on with</strong> when we're talking about work.
214660	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I'm <strong>getting on with</strong> my work, Neil.
217216	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Good! And we work out which meaning is which by listening to the context.
221613	Letâ€™s <strong>get on with</strong> the programme and take a look at some phrasal verbs with <strong>move</strong>.
226277	Hereâ€™s a clip.
227001	<strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br></strong>Pete <strong>moved in</strong> three months ago .
229532	It's really time for us to <strong>move on</strong> .
232209	I'm going to ask him to <strong>move out</strong> and live somewhere else .
235507	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we had <strong>move in</strong>, <strong>move on</strong> and <strong>move out</strong>.
240531	<strong>Neil<br>Move in </strong>means<strong> start to live in a place</strong>.
244014	If you want to say <strong>who</strong> you're starting to live with, use <strong>with</strong>, like this:
248077	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Pete <strong>moved in with</strong> Robin six months ago.
251297	<strong>Neil<br></strong>To say <strong>the place</strong> that someone started living, use <strong>into</strong> instead of <strong>in</strong>.
257214	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Pete <strong>moved into</strong> Robinâ€™s house six months ago.
261043	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>Now,<strong> move out</strong> is the opposite.
263370	It's when you stop living somewhere and go to live somewhere new. So it describes a change.
269351	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>It does. And <strong>move on</strong> also describes a change, but not just about housing: <strong>move on</strong> has a sense of progressing to something different.
279166	So, Robin is going to end his friendship with Pete, Neil.
283081	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Well thatâ€™s certainly a change.
285148	And now we must <strong>move on </strong>too: It's quiz time!
293789	Number one. I'm <strong>getting on with</strong> my school project.
298028	Is getting on with here about a) a relationship or b) finishing something?
304111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's b).It's about <strong>finishing something </strong>â€“ a school project.
310974	Number two. I'm not very happy with my job.
314105	I'll have to a) move in, b) move out, or c) move on.
320626	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And it's c) <strong>move on</strong>.
323939	It's about changing to something new.
326382	Last one. I've just found a new flat.
329922	I'm a) moving in or b) moving on next week.
336313	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And it's a) <strong>moving in</strong>.
338798	That's what we say about starting to live somewhere.
341472	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And that's the end of the quiz.
343427	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>But before we go, here's that top tip for learning vocabulary.
347133	When you see or hear a phrasal verb, pay close attention to all the words in the sentence.
353977	Write the sentence down if you can.
355788	That will help you learn and remember the meaning.
359024	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's a good tip.
