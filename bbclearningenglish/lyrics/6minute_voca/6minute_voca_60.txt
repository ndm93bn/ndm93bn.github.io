12444	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Callum.
15822	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me Catherine. In this programme weâ€™re talking about interjections.
20188	Interjections are words that we use to express an emotion or feeling.
24850	<strong>Callum<br></strong>For example <strong>Oh!</strong> expresses surprise and <strong>Hooray!</strong> expresses pleasure when something good happens. Weâ€™ll give you plenty of other examples.
34555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Weâ€™ll have a quiz; and weâ€™ll finish with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
39999	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Here are Peter and Kylie. Theyâ€™re at home in their kitchen.
44850	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And while you listen, think about this question: What emotion does Peter express by the word <strong>Phew!</strong> at the end of this conversation?
53888	<strong>INSERT</strong> <br><strong>Peter and Kylie</strong>
53888	Peter:<strong> Ow!</strong>
55157	Kylie: Whatâ€™s wrong?
56111	Peter: Iâ€™ve just cut my finger.
58100	Kylie:<strong> Oh!</strong> Quick, whereâ€™s the First Aid kit?
60855	Peter: Itâ€™s in that drawer.
62000	Kylie: Got it. <strong>Ugh</strong>! Thereâ€™s blood everywhere.
66885	<strong>Oh no!</strong> Itâ€™s on my T-shirt now. Let me see your finger.
73999	Peter: There you go.
75666	Kylie: There, got the plaster on it, <strong>hooray</strong>!
78888	Peter:<strong> Phew</strong>! Thanks.
81111	<strong>STING</strong>
86666	<strong>Callum<br></strong>So that was Peter and Kylie. And we asked: What emotion does Peter express by the word <strong>Phew</strong>! at the end of the conversation?
94111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is that he expresses relief. Peter feels relieved that Kylie has got the plaster on his finger.
101399	<strong>Callum<br></strong>He does. People use interjections a lot in everyday speech. Itâ€™s interesting that one little word like <strong>Phew!</strong> can express so much, isnâ€™t it?
109888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is. And thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to learn to use interjections when your speaking, to make your English sound more natural and fluent.
117555	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Now, interjections usually come at the beginning of what we are saying, but they can sometimes come at the end.
123400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So Peter says <strong>Phew! Thanks</strong>, but he could have said <strong>Thanks. Phew!
130333	<strong>Callum<br></strong>But, whichever way he says it, the interjection stands alone. There are no words to connect it to what comes after or before it.
138357	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right, and if youâ€™re writing a conversation with interjections, theyâ€™re usually followed by an exclamation mark.
145489	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Because the exclamation mark emphasises the strength of the emotion and increases the interest for the reader.
151940	<strong>Phew!</strong> with an exclamation mark looks more dramatic than <strong>Phew.</strong> with a full stop.
158111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It does. Thatâ€™s interesting, isnâ€™t it? Letâ€™s have our first clip.
162444	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1 </strong> <br>Peter:<strong> Ow!</strong>
163600	Kylie: Whatâ€™s wrong?
164600	Peter: Iâ€™ve just cut my finger.
166588	Kylie:<strong> Oh!</strong> Quick, whereâ€™s the First Aid kit?
169333	Peter: Itâ€™s in that drawer.
170555	Kylie: Got it.
171422	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. So what does Peter express with <strong>Ow!
175395	<strong>Callum<br></strong><strong>Ow!</strong> expresses sudden pain. We can say <strong>Ouch!</strong> too. They mean the same.
181400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the second interjection was <strong>Oh!</strong> Kylie uses it to show surprise and alarm that Peter has cut his finger.
188713	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Yes. Now if you wanted to describe the scene in writing you would have to say: <strong>Peter shouted in sudden pain</strong>, instead of using<strong> Ow!</strong>
198200	Or <strong>Peterâ€™s voice expressed relief</strong>, instead of using<strong> Phew!
202900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. Interjections are very useful when speaking, but theyâ€™re not often used in written English, except for writing dialogues like the one between Peter and Kylie.
213781	<strong>Callum<br></strong>OK. Letâ€™s have our second clip.
216333	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2</strong> <br>Kylie: <strong>Ugh</strong>! Thereâ€™s blood everywhere.
219888	<strong>Oh no!</strong> Itâ€™s on my T-shirt now. Let me see your finger.
226888	Peter: There you go.
228555	Kylie: There, got the plaster on it, <strong>hooray</strong>!
231700	Peter:<strong> Phew</strong>! Thanks.
233733	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Kylie uses three interjections there!
237333	No we donâ€™t usually use so many together but the situation is quite dramatic, so itâ€™s natural to use them together there.
245087	<strong>Callum<br></strong>There was <strong>Ugh!</strong>, which expresses disgust at the blood everywhere.
250111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And there was <strong>Oh no!</strong> which expresses shock.
253529	Kylie was a bit shocked that the blood was on her T-shirt.
257111	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And finally <strong>Hooray! </strong>That expresses pleasure or delight that something good has happened.
262964	Kylie was very pleased that sheâ€™d managed to get the plaster on Peterâ€™s finger.
267170	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Other common interjections are <strong>Wow! </strong>for admiration, <strong>Oops!</strong> for when you make a mistake and <strong>Yippee!</strong> for excitement.

313972	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Itâ€™s a) Wow!...for admiration.
318222	<strong>Callum.<br></strong>Correct! Number three: Amyâ€™s passed her driving test. Is it a) Oops! Or b) Phew!
327260	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Itâ€™s b) Phew!...for relief
330333	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Excellent! Thatâ€™s the end of the quiz and congratulations if you got them all right.
334666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Before we go, hereâ€™s todayâ€™s top tip.
337511	When youâ€™re speaking everyday English, you donâ€™t always need to use high-level vocabulary to express your meaning.
344400	Itâ€™s more important to be clear and sometimes simple words like interjections express your meaning much more clearly than a sentence with advanced vocabulary in it.
