12500	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine.
16300	<strong>Neil</strong><br> And I'm Neil. Today we're looking at the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>less </strong>and<strong> -</strong><strong>free.
22800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Suffixes are two or three letters at the end of a word that affect its meaning.
28200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We'll look at what the suffixes <strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-less</strong> mean and give you some examples.
33708	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There'll be a quiz.
34900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...and we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
40406	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's start by listening to Markus. He's a politician and he's talking about his party's policies.
48600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Right. So while you listen, think about this question: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke? Here's Markus.
57800	<strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Markus<br></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves.
67600	We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones.
72404	We're going to extend the smoking ban to include e-cigarettes, which may be <strong>smokeless</strong>, but they aren't <strong>harmless</strong>, and we're going to raise the penalties for <strong>careless</strong> drivers.
85300	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> So we asked you: Do e-cigarettes produce smoke?
89907	<strong>Neil</strong><br> And the answer is: No they don't. E-cigarettes are <strong>smokeless</strong>.
95950	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And<strong> smokeless </strong>is a key word in this programme because it ends with the suffix<strong> less, </strong>spelt<strong> l-e-s-s.</strong>This means 'without'.
108000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So <strong>smokeless</strong> cigarettes are cigarettes without smoke - they don't produce any smoke.
115300	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And if something is <strong>harmless</strong>, it doesn't cause harm.
120800	Markus said that e-cigarettes are not <strong>harmless</strong>. In other words, they are dangerous.
127000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Markus also said his party was going to raise penalties - or increase punishments - for <strong>careless </strong>drivers - people who drive without care.
138100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, <strong>careless </strong>means not being careful.
141400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, by adding <strong>-less</strong> to the nouns <strong>smoke, harm </strong>and<strong> care,</strong> we turn them into adjectives.
148600	Let's hear some more examples with <strong>-less</strong>.
151624	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Markus<br></strong>We're focusing on the <strong>jobless</strong>, the <strong>homeless</strong>, the sick and the elderly - people who are <strong>powerless</strong> to change things for themselves.
161200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So we had the <strong>jobless</strong>.
164500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's people without jobs.
166171	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...the <strong>homeless</strong>.
167592	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...people who have nowhere to live. We can create a noun to describe a particular group of people, by using the word <strong>the</strong> with a <strong>Â­-less</strong> word. <strong>The jobless</strong>, <strong>the homeless</strong>.
180644	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Lastly, we had the adjective<strong> powerless, </strong>which describes people who are unable to do certain things.
187500	If we add <strong>the</strong>, we get a group noun: <strong>the powerless</strong>.
192500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's have another clip. Listen out for the suffix <strong>-free.
197094	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Markus<br></strong>We're campaigning for more <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong> zones.
201900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We had <strong>car-free</strong> and <strong>smoke-free</strong>.
205200	Now if you add <strong>-free</strong> to a noun, you get an adjective, meaning that there isn't any of that noun, or it's not allowed, or both.
214478	<strong>Car-free </strong>means there are no cars because they're not allowed.
218771	<strong>Smoke-free</strong> means smoking is not allowed and so there is no smoke.

232831	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-</strong><strong>free </strong>and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong>.
236900	And Neil how was your journey to work today; <strong>stress-free</strong>, I hope?
240950	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, actually, it was awful!
243800	I tried to use my <strong>contactless </strong>credit card to pay for the train, but it didn't work, so I had to walk all the way.
251390	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Oh, won't do you any harm, Neil.
253679	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No. It's good for me, I suppose.
254800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is. And <strong>contactless</strong> credit cards are the cards that work without a PIN number.
260500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Usually you use either <strong>-</strong><strong>free</strong> or <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> with a particular word.
265999	But occasionally you can use<strong>-free</strong> and <strong>-</strong><strong>less</strong> interchangeably, as in <strong>sugarless</strong> and <strong>sugar-free.</strong>These both mean: without sugar.
275600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But be very careful with the words <strong>careless</strong> and <strong>carefree </strong>because they have very different meanings.
283300	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, they do. A<strong> careless </strong>person is someone who doesn't take much care over what they're doing.
289163	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...whereas a<strong> carefree </strong>person like you, Neil, doesn't worry about anything.
293900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, I don't worry about a thing.
295700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, it's time for a quiz. Choose the correct word. Ready? Number one: Jack looks scary, but he's actually very kind and gentle.
306970	He's a) careless b) harmless c) powerless.
313400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is b) <strong>harmless</strong>.
317850	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number two. Dalya doesn't check her work properly so she makes lots of mistakes.
323990	She's very a) careless b) carefree c) contactless.
331000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is a)<strong> careless</strong>.
334881	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number three: To cut the risk of cancer, some people smoke e-cigarettes which are a) smokeless b) smokeless-free c) smoke-free.
346900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is a) <strong>smokeless.
350500	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.
354040	<strong>Neil</strong><br> And now, here's today's top tip for learning vocabulary: record yourself saying new words and then listen to them every day.
