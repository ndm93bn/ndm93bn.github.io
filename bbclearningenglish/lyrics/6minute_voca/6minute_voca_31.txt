13888	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Robâ€¦
18000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And Iâ€™m Catherine. And this programme is all about linking words, the words and phrases we use to connect ideas and events when we speak or write.
27222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, we call them linking words and phrases. They help people to follow what weâ€™re saying by showing how ideas are connected to each other.
35222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>First</strong>, weâ€™ll look at some examplesâ€¦
37666	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Next</strong>, there will be a short quizâ€¦
39555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>finally</strong>, weâ€™ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
45718	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>But to start with, letâ€™s listen to Angela talking about a lucky escape she had.
51100	While you listen, try to answer this question: who or what saved Angela in the end?
57609	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Hereâ€™s Angela.
59299	<strong>INSERT</strong> <br><strong>Presenter<br></strong>So Angela, tell us: what did you escape from?
63111	<strong>Angela<br> </strong>A shark.
64333	<strong>Presenter<br> Wow! Reallyâ€¦?
65945	<strong>Angela<br> </strong>Yes, <strong>what happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden,</strong> I saw a huge black shape coming towards me.
73173	<strong>To begin with</strong>, I thought it was a dolphinâ€¦
75500	<strong>Presenter<br> </strong>But it wasnâ€™t. So, <strong>what happened next</strong>?
78902	<strong>Angela<br> </strong>Well, I <strong>then</strong> quickly realised it was a shark. <strong>Luckily</strong>, Iâ€™m a very fast swimmer.
84222	But <strong>in the end</strong>, it was a boat that saved me.
87666	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Thatâ€™s an incredible story! We asked: who or what saved Angela?
93100	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>It was a boat. Angela said â€œ<strong>In the end</strong>, a boat saved me.â€
97777	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Lucky lady. Now Angela helped us to follow her story by using linking words and phrases to tell us what happened, when it happened and how she felt about it. Letâ€™s have a look at some of them.
109999	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>OK, right, now the first one was right at the beginning.
113666	Angela said "<strong>What happened wasâ€¦</strong>"and this is a really good way tointroduce a story because it grabs the listenerâ€™s attention and it tells them to get ready to hear a story. Have a listen.
126666	<strong>Angela<br> What happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden</strong>, I saw a huge black shape coming towards me.
132801	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>OK, good start. Now another way to tell your story clearly is to say words that show the order of events.
140349	Catherine and I did this at the beginning of this programme when we used words like <strong>First</strong>, <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Finally</strong>: <strong>First</strong>, weâ€™ll look at examples â€¦,
150223	<strong>Catherine<br> Next</strong>, there will be a short quizâ€¦
152133	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>And <strong>finally</strong>, weâ€™ll leave you with a top tipâ€¦
154333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now letâ€™s listen to how Angela used words and phrases like these.
159000	<strong>INSERT</strong> <br><strong>Angela<br> What happened was</strong> I was swimming off the coast, when <strong>all of a sudden,</strong> I saw a huge black shape coming towards me.
165268	<strong>To begin with</strong>, I thought it was a dolphinâ€¦
167658	<strong>Presenter<br> </strong>But it wasnâ€™t. So, <strong>what happened next</strong>?
170937	<strong>Angela<br> </strong>Well, I <strong>then</strong> quickly realised it was a shark.
174035	<strong>Luckily,</strong> Iâ€™m a very fast swimmer. But <strong>in the end</strong>, it was a boat that saved me.
178886	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>So, when you get to the end of your story use a phrase like <strong>in the end </strong>or <strong>finally </strong>to show that your storyâ€™s about to finish.
188716	<strong>INSERT</strong> <br><strong>Angela<br> </strong>But in the end it was a boat that saved me.
191281	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>OK. Now, letâ€™s hear Angela tell us about how the boat saved her.
195888	<strong>INSERT  <br>Angela<br> Fortunately</strong>, the boat had already seen the shark and fired a rocket, which scared the creature off.
201332	<strong>Presenter<br> </strong>That was lucky!
203322	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Wow, so Angela uses the adverb <strong>fortunately</strong> as a linking word to comment on this.
209666	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br> Yes and in the first clip Angela said: "<strong>Luckily, Iâ€™m a fast swimmer</strong>."
214927	Other comment adverbs you may hear include <strong>unfortunately</strong>, <strong>sadly </strong>and so on.
221473	And we can also use adverbs and adverbial phrases like <strong>suddenly</strong> or <strong>all of a sudden</strong>, which we heard in the first clip to say how things happen.
231558	<strong>STING</strong>
238111	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Weâ€™re talking about words and phrases that link different sentences and parts of a story.
243734	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Yep and itâ€™s time for a quick recap. So, to start a story we hadâ€¦
249111	<strong>Rob<br> Well, what happened was</strong>â€¦
251222	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>For ordering events:
253000	<strong>Rob<br> First of all, to begin with, then, next, after thatâ€¦</strong>
258830	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>To finish a storyâ€¦
260444	<strong>Rob<br> Finally, in the end.
262810	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>To make a comment:
264333	<strong>Rob<br> Luckily, unfortunately, sadly</strong>.
268669	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And lastly we had:
270600	<strong>Rob<br> </strong><strong>Suddenly, all of a sudden</strong>.
273136	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Great, now itâ€™s quiz time. Choose the correct linking word or phrase to fill the gaps.
282666	Number one: I tried for weeks to get a ticket to the final.
287777	[sfx: beep] I gave up. Is it a) In the end or b) Next.
297666	<strong>Rob</strong>  <br>Itâ€™s a) <strong>In the end</strong>.
300222	<strong>Catherine</strong>   <br>Well done. Number two. It started to rain.
304079	[sfx: beep] I had an umbrella with me. Is it a) Suddenly or b) Luckily.
313666	<strong>Rob</strong>     <br>Itâ€™s b) <strong>Luckily</strong>.
315777	<strong>Catherine</strong>     <br>Finally, number 3: Which is the correct phrase to introduce your story?
322137	Is it a) What happened was â€¦ or b) What happened it â€¦ ?
330555	<strong>Rob</strong>     <br>And itâ€™s a) <strong>What happened was</strong>â€¦
333444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is, and well done to you if you got those right.
336348	Now before we finish hereâ€™s Rob with a quick tip for learning vocabulary.
341111	<strong>Rob</strong>     <br>Yes, why not make a note of new linking devices when hear other people speak English â€“ on the bus, waiting in a queue or watching TV.
349607	Note them on your phone or just write them down somewhere and then try to use them yourself.
