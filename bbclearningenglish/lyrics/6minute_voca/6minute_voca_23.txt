1	(Introduction...)
13464	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherineâ€¦
18266	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦and me, Neil. In this programme, weâ€™re looking at reporting verbs.
25222	Theyâ€™re verbs that we use when we talk about what someone else has said.
29955	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So verbs like <strong>suggest</strong>, <strong>deny</strong> and <strong>insist.
39200	Letâ€™s start by listening to Simon. And Simon is a political news reporter.
45200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And while youâ€™re listening to Simonâ€™s news report, hereâ€™s a question for you to think about:
50622	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Why did the minister lie in her previous interview?
54700	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Simon<br></strong>In a previous interview, the minister had <strong>denied</strong> knowing anything about the scandal.
61122	However, she later <strong>apologised for</strong> saying this and <strong>admitted</strong> that she had lied.
67625	She <strong>insisted</strong> that she had not intended to cause any harm and <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures.
78661	When <strong>advised</strong> to reconsider her position, she had initially <strong>demanded</strong> to know why, but eventually <strong>offered</strong> to resign.
90222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We asked: Why did the minister lie in her previous interview?
94800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is: she <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures.
102222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Scandal. Now itâ€™s interesting that the report uses the verb <strong>suggested</strong>.
108111	So why didnâ€™t Simon use <strong>said</strong> - She <strong>said</strong> thatâ€¦?
112333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, <strong>suggested</strong> tells us that the minister said it, but not in a very strong or direct way.
119037	And thatâ€™s because she didnâ€™t want to embarrass the important public figures.
123333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And thatâ€™s an example of why reporting verbs are useful.
127599	We can always use <strong>say, tell</strong> or <strong>ask</strong>, but other reporting verbs express slightly different meanings and attitudes.
135500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, they do. So reporting verbs make your writing or speaking more accurate and more interesting too.
142116	Now listen for more reporting verbs in this clip.
145541	<strong>CLIP 1 <br></strong>In a previous interview, the minister had <strong>denied</strong> knowing anything about the scandal.
152287	However, she later <strong>apologised</strong> <strong>for</strong> saying this and <strong>admitted</strong> that she had lied.
158654	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So we heard<strong> denied knowing anything. Denied</strong> has a negative meaning.
164759	It means she said she didnâ€™t know anything about the scandal.
168059	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. But then she<strong> apologised for saying this.
171167	She said she was sorry for saying this.
173756	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And lastly, she <strong>admitted that she had lied</strong>.
177260	<strong>Admit </strong>is the opposite of<strong> deny. </strong>It means you say that something is true.
182700	We usually use <strong>admit</strong> when someone has to say that something is true, although they would prefer not to.
189155	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now on to the next clip.
191999	<strong>CLIP 2<br></strong>She <strong>insisted</strong> that she had not intended to cause any harm and <strong>suggested</strong> that it had been necessary to protect certain important public figures.
204200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>There we heard the verb <strong>insisted</strong>.
207100	<strong>To insist</strong> means to say something strongly, especially when other people say something different.
213555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, the minister said strongly that it was incorrect that she had intended to cause harm.
219081	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now weâ€™ve already looked at the verb <strong>suggested</strong>.
221887	But itâ€™s worth noticing that <strong>insist, suggest</strong> and <strong>admit</strong> are all followed by a <strong>that clause</strong> in the news report.
229040	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>For example, <strong>she suggested that it had been necessary</strong>.
233894	But we often leave the word <strong>that</strong> out â€“ <strong>she suggested it had been necessary</strong>.
240603	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Other reporting verbs have different patterns.
243823	Some verbs are followed by a <strong>verb plus i-n-g</strong>, such as <strong>deny</strong>.
249200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And some are followed by <strong>to plus an infinitive</strong>.
252530	Youâ€™ll hear three example of this in our final clip.
256600	<strong>CLIP 3<br></strong>When <strong>advised</strong> to reconsider her position, she had initially <strong>demanded</strong> to know why, but eventually <strong>offered</strong> to resign.
267200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. We heard <strong>advised</strong>, which means <strong>told,</strong> but in a polite or indirect way.
273500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>demanded, </strong>which means <strong>asked</strong> in a slightly aggressive way.
278271	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And finally she <strong>offered to resign</strong>.
281753	So she said that she was willing to resign if thatâ€™s what people wanted.
285786	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.

317770	Number two: When questioned by the police, the boy <strong>said</strong> that he had stolen the car.
324586	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So the boy <strong>admitted</strong> that he had stolen the car.
328222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Number three: Several people have said that thereâ€™s a possibility that the actorâ€™s marriage might be in trouble.
336648	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answerâ€™s<strong> suggested</strong>.

343400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done indeed. And finally, hereâ€™s a top tip to help you learn new words more quickly.
348606	Keep a list of reporting verbs and study their meanings.
