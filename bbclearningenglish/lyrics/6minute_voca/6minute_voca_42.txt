1	(Introduction...)
12600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello! I'm Catherine, and this is Rob.
16055	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, hello! And welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary.
20333	Today we're talking about adjectives that end in <strong>i-c,</strong> pronounced <strong>ic,</strong> and adjectives that end in <strong>i-c-a-l</strong>, pronounced <strong>ical</strong>.
30330	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>First, let's listen to Hannah. She's talking about her favourite books.
35229	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Our question today is: why does Hannah get most of her books from the library?
40358	Listen carefully and find out!
44555	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Hannah<br></strong>I'm always reading! I like <strong>classic</strong> English novels, by writers like Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.
52444	I also like non-fiction; especially books about interesting <strong>historical</strong> characters. I love buying books, but it's so expensive!
62100	Mostly, I borrow books from the library. It's much more <strong>economical</strong>.
67842	<strong>STING</strong>
70119	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, why does Hannah prefer to get her books from the library? Because it's more <strong>economical.
77000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hannah mentioned that she likes to read novels. Do you remember what type of novels she likes to read? Listen once again:
84400	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br></strong>I like <strong>classic</strong> English novels, by writers like Jane Austen or Charles Dickens.
90500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hannah said she likes to read <strong>classic</strong> novels. The word <strong>classic </strong>ends in <strong>i-c</strong>.
97066	It's an adjective that describes something that's a particularly good example of a category â€“ or a particularly famous example.
105455	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, novels by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens are <strong>classic</strong>, because they're particularly good, and very famous, examples of novels.
113444	And they've been popular for a long time, so we could say they've stood the test of time.
117666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly, a bit like you Rob.
119177	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thank you.
119822	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You're welcome. But be careful because people often confuse <strong>classic</strong> with another adjective: <strong>classical</strong>.
127504	Now<strong> classical</strong>, ending in <strong>i-c-a-l</strong> has a slightly different meaning â€“ it describes a formal and often quite old style of art in forms such as painting, theatre, architecture and so on.
143800	Question for you Rob, do you like <strong>classical</strong> music?
148100	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh. Occasionally, but I do find it a bit heavy going.
152000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>A bit much is it?
152977	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Sometimes, yes.
153700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You're more of a BeyoncĂ© man?
155222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, that's me.
156444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, so let's listen again to another clip:
159666	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>I also like non-fiction; especially books about interesting <strong>historical</strong> characters.
166555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Historical </strong>is another <strong>i-c-a-l</strong> adjective â€“ and it means 'connected to stories about the past'.
174888	So Rob â€“ name me a <strong>historical</strong> character that you particularly identify with.
182222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's a hard one, but I'd say Captain Cook.
185222	He liked to travel and he went round the world discovering new places, which is something I like to do.
189333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You do, don't you.
190111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So I can identify with him, yes.
192222	Moving onâ€¦ now the <strong>i-c</strong> adjective - <strong>historic </strong>- has a slightly different meaning: it describes something important, or something that will people will remember for a long time.
202800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, if something really important and amazing happens today, we'll say <strong>today is a historic day</strong>.
211333	Like the day Newcastle United wins the European cup Rob!
216888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, in your dreams I think.
218444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well maybe, but if it ever happened it would be a <strong>historic</strong> day.
223999	Now a quick pronunciation tip for you: we pronounce<strong> historic</strong> and <strong>historical</strong> with the stress on the same syllable in both words,the<strong> 'to'</strong>.
234000	And it's the same with<strong> classic</strong> and <strong>classical</strong>: in both words, the stress is on the same syllable, this time, <strong>'cla'.
241777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So:<strong> Historic, historical. Classic, classical.
246777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah.
247111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now listen again to one more clip:
249145	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br></strong>Mostly, I borrow books from the library. It's much more <strong>economical</strong>.
255366	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, we use the adjective<strong> economical</strong> â€“ or as some people say, <strong>economical</strong> â€“ with <strong>i-c-a-l</strong> when something is cheap, or good value for money.
267644	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But the adjective <strong>economic</strong> with <strong>i-c</strong> has a different meaning: <strong>economic</strong> means 'connected to the subject of money and finance'.
277111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, we might say, <strong>the bus is more economical than the train</strong>, and we would say, <strong>the country has economic problems</strong>.
284666	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English dot com
290397	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about adjectives that end in â€“<strong>ic</strong> and â€“<strong>ical</strong>.
295800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Like <strong>economic</strong> and <strong>economical</strong>.
298507	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now it's time for a little quiz! Listen to this, then answer question one.
303424	<strong>[sfx: music]</strong>
310258	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Question one: was that an example of <strong>classic</strong> music, or was it <strong>classical</strong> music?
315666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It was <strong>classical </strong>music. Not too much for you Rob?
318555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>No, it's enough, just enough.
319913	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Okay, question two: if you watch a film about the past, is it a <strong>historic</strong> film or a <strong>historical</strong> film?
328222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's a <strong>historical</strong> film. Last question!
332222	If you read the news about business and the financial markets, are you reading the <strong>economic</strong> news or the <strong>economical </strong>news?
340444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's the <strong>economic </strong>news. And that's the end of the quiz. Well done!
344555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, well done. Finally, here's a piece of vocabulary learning advice.
