13444	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Hi! Iâ€™m Peter.
15505	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And Iâ€™m Catherine. Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary.
21830	And today weâ€™re talking about acronyms.
26555	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Examples of acronyms are the name <strong>FIFA</strong>, thatâ€™s the international federation of association football, and <strong>BBC</strong>.
34999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Weâ€™ll talk about where these names come from and we'll tell you how we say and write them.
41000	<strong>Peter<br></strong>There will be a quiz of course; and weâ€™ll also bring you a top tip for remembering these words.
50444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Letâ€™s start by listening to James. Heâ€™s giving a lecture about the United Nations.
56599	<strong>Peter<br></strong>And while youâ€™re listening: Can you guess where the name <strong>UNESCO</strong> comes from?
62666	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>James<br></strong>The United Nations aims to encourage international cooperation and preserve world peace.
69222	A number of different organisations are part of it. One of the most well-known is <strong>UNESCO</strong>.
76100	Thatâ€™s the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.
81402	But you may also have heard of the <strong>W-H-O</strong>, the <strong>I-M-F</strong>, and the<strong> W-B-G</strong>, for example.
89152	Do you know what they are? The <strong>UN</strong> performs most of its work through these different organisations.
97999	<strong>Peter<br></strong>So we asked you: Can you guess where the name <strong>UNESCO</strong> comes from?
102777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is that it comes from the first letters of the organisationâ€™s full name: <strong>U</strong>nited <strong>N</strong>ations <strong>E</strong>ducational, <strong>S</strong>cientific and <strong>C</strong>ultural <strong>O</strong>rganisation: <strong>UNESCO</strong>.
115666	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Now with acronyms like <strong>UNESCO</strong>, we say them as if they are a word: <strong>UNESCO</strong>.
121925	We donâ€™t spell out the letters separately. We don't say<strong> U-N-E-S-C-O</strong>.
127000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Other acronyms like this that are very well-known are <strong>NATO</strong>, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and <strong>NASA</strong>, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
139666	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Thatâ€™s easy for you to say. By the way,<strong> FIFA</strong> is a bit of a trick.
144508	The acronym actually comes from the French name for the organisation, not the English. Federation Internationale de Football Association.
152550	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Nice accent.
153666	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Merci.
154666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So what about the other acronyms James mentioned? Letâ€™s listen.
160300	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br>James <br></strong>â€¦ you may also have heard of the <strong>W-H-O</strong>, the <strong>I-M-F</strong>, and the<strong> W-B-G</strong>, for example.
168333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now these next acronyms are a bit different. We spell out the initial letters separately.
175006	Can you guess what these letters stand for? <strong>W-H-O</strong>.
180607	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Thatâ€™s the World Health Organisation.
184000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is. Now:<strong> I-M-F</strong>.
186800	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Itâ€™s the International Monetary Fund.
189143	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>W-B-G</strong>?
193693	<strong>Peter<br></strong>The World Bank Group.
195333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s worth remembering that weusually write both types of acronym with capital letters. Now for another clip.
203888	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br>James<br></strong>The <strong>UN</strong> performs most of its work through these different organisations.
208999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now itâ€™s interesting that James started off by saying the United Nations.
214932	But here he says the <strong>UN</strong>. Whyâ€™s that do you think?
219222	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Well, using acronyms saves time and it makes the organisations seem more familiar.
225444	With the second type of acronym like <strong>U-N</strong>, where you spell out the letters, we sometimes use the full name the first time we mention the organisation and then, once weâ€™ve done that, we go on to use the acronym as we continue to talk about it.
238939	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. But with the first type of acronym like <strong>UNESCO</strong>, where you say it as a word, we nearly always use just the acronym.
247888	Thatâ€™s probably because the full names are often so long that the acronyms have actuallybecome like words to replace them.
256147	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Yes, in fact there are a few words in English that used to be acronyms but have now become ordinary words.
262888	These words are not written with capital letters. For example <strong>scuba</strong> as in <strong>scuba diving.</strong>
268111	This comes from <strong>s</strong>elf-<strong>c</strong>ontained <strong>u</strong>nderwater <strong>b</strong>reathing <strong>a</strong>pparatus.
272688	And <strong>laser</strong> comes from <strong>l</strong>ight <strong>a</strong>mplification by <strong>s</strong>timulated <strong>e</strong>mission of <strong>r</strong>adiation.
278814	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Wow, well yes, that is quite a mouthful, isnâ€™t it?
281999	<strong>Peter<br></strong>It certainly does go onâ€¦
283935	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
291666	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Weâ€™re talking about acronyms.
293888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s quiz time! And this time itâ€™s a bit of a general knowledge game because weâ€™re going to see if you know what some popular acronyms stand for.
305443	And not all of them are organisations. So number one: <strong>WWW</strong>.
313111	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Itâ€™s the World Wide Web.
316222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is, indeed. Now number two: <strong>RAM</strong>.
321111	<strong>Peter</strong><br>Thatâ€™s Random Access Memory. We use it for a type of computer memory.
326111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We do. And the last one: <strong>CIA</strong>.
330666	<strong>Peter<br></strong>Itâ€™s the Central Intelligence Agency in the US.
334104	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is indeed - and well done if you got them all right.
337504	<strong>Peter<br></strong>And before we go, hereâ€™s a vocabulary tip.
340450	There are a lot of acronyms in everyday life as well as those that are organisations.
345111	For example: <strong>ATM</strong>, <strong>DIY</strong> and <strong>FYI</strong>.
349858	We use them all the time. When you see an acronym written in capital letters, check out what it stands for online or find a dictionary.
358000	They do make sense and are easy to remember when you know the full name or meaning.
363000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thereâ€™s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.
