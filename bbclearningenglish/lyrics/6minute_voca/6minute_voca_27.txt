1	(Introduction...)
12555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn.
16303	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'm Catherine. Today we're talking about words and phrases that we use to express our attitude to what we're saying or writing.
26893	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So two common examples are <strong>fortunately</strong>, which shows I'm pleased, and <strong>I'm afraid, </strong>which shows I'm sorry about something.
38888	So let's start by listening to Rob. He's talking about electric cars. Are you a fan of the electric car, Catherine?
48302	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I'm not a fan of any kind of car actually, Finn. If I had one I would probably consider electric.
55219	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Very environmentally considerate of you.
57900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you. And before we hear from Rob, here's a question: What is Rob's attitude towards public transport and bicycles? Here he is:
67999	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>I must admit</strong> I'm not sure about the whole idea of electric cars.
72055	I mean <strong>obviously</strong> we need to find alternative forms of energy, but <strong>if you ask me</strong>, reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority.
81085	<strong>Ideally</strong> we would all use public transport or bicycles.
84867	<strong>Seriously</strong>, I think people should be given tax breaks if they don't own a car!
89714	But <strong>of course</strong> that's not going to happen any time soon.
96555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So Rob's attitude is that <strong>ideally</strong> we would all use public transport or bicycles.
103475	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or to put that another way, he thinks it would be ideal if we all used public transport or bicycles.
110316	By beginning the sentence with <strong>ideally</strong>, Rob expresses his attitude nicely in justone word. Right.
118675	Let's listen for more words and phrases that shows Rob's attitude in this clip.
124666	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Rob <br></strong><strong>I must admit</strong> I'm not sure about the whole idea of electric cars.
129000	I mean <strong>obviously</strong> we need to find alternative forms of energy, but <strong>if you ask me,</strong> reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority.
138500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So he begins with the phrase <strong>I must admit</strong>. Now what does that tell us?
143386	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, we usually use that expression when we're going to say something that might be unpopular. Perhaps we're a little embarrassed to say it.
151300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, Rob knows that a lot of people are keen on the idea of electric cars, but he's going to say something different.
159503	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. Then Rob used the word <strong>obviously</strong>.
162869	People use <strong>obviously</strong> to show that an idea is easy to see or understand.
168393	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And by using it here, Rob means that the need for alternative forms of energy is clear to him, even though he has other ideas on the subject too.
179700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Because he then said <strong>if you ask me</strong>, reducing the numbers of cars on the road should be the priority.
187444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So this phrase:<strong> if you ask me - </strong>it's like<strong> in my opinion</strong>, isn't it?
193222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is, but it tells us more about the speaker's attitude.
196600	It's less direct than <strong>in my opinion</strong>, and it shows that Rob realises that other people might disagree. Let's have another clip.
205928	<strong>INSERT<br>Rob<br></strong><strong>Seriously</strong>, I think people should be given tax breaks if they don't own a car!
211222	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Seriously.</strong> Now why does he use that wordhere?
215283	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Seriously</strong> shows that Rob knows that his idea might sound like a joke to some people.
220555	But he wants to make it clear that it's not a joke.
223750	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh yes, people often use it when they have been joking and they want to start being serious, don't they?
230700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, they do. ight, listen again:
233333	<strong>INSERT<br>Rob<br></strong>But <strong>of course</strong> that's not going to happen any time soon.
237004	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, <strong>of course</strong> is a very familiar expression. Now here Rob uses it to show his understanding of the real situation.
247000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Does it also sound slightly critical of the government?
250984	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, I think it does. He's not expecting any new government policies that will change the situation on the roads.
258960	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
267000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're talking about words and phrases that show attitude.
272259	<strong>Obviously,</strong> they are very important for expressing yourself and understanding what other people mean!
278427	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. But <strong>I'm afraid</strong> they can be tricky to define in a dictionary, can't they, Finn?
283722	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, they can. In fact you can often only understand their real meaning from the context that they are in.
290100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. And it's nearly the end of the show so obviously it's time for a quiz!
298268	So question one: Which is correct? <br>a) I must admit I haven't done much work today or b) If you ask me, I haven't done much work today.
309333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's a) <strong>I must admit</strong>.
312881	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Correct.Good. Now question two: a) Ideally, the weather will affect our plans for the day or b) Obviously, the weather will affect our plans for the day.
325333	<strong>Finn</strong><br>And that one is b) <strong>obviously</strong>.
328367	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Correct. And question three: a) OK, but seriously, what do you really think? <br>b) OK, but of course, what do you really think?
339446	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And this time it's a) <strong>seriously</strong>.
343200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes it is. And well done if you got those right at home.
346935	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And now, here's a game you can play witha friend to help you practise these words and phrases.
351800	Have a conversation with them and try to use as many of these words and phrases as you can. Give yourself a point each time you manage to do it.
