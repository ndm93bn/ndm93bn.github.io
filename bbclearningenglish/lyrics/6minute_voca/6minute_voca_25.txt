13241	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn.
17100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about words like <strong>someone</strong>,<strong> nothing </strong>and<strong> anywhere</strong>.
24880	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, let's start by listening to Tracey. She's talking to a friend about a problem she has.
31566	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And here's a question for you: What is Tracey worried about? Here she is.
36222	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Tracey<br></strong>My boyfriend seems to be very busy these days. I'm worried thereâ€™s <strong>someone</strong> else in his life.
42819	I mean, most evenings he could be <strong>anywhere</strong> for all I know.
48300	He always says that he couldn't love <strong>anyone</strong> except me.
52857	And <strong>everyone</strong> knows that you should trust people you love.
56333	But do you think I should say <strong>something</strong> to him? There's <strong>no one</strong> else I can ask.
63555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So that's Tracey. And we asked you: What is Tracey worried about?
69069	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And the answer is: She's worried that there's <strong>someone</strong> else in her boyfriend's life.
73826	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh yes. Now <strong>someone</strong> is one of the words we're looking at today.
78700	<strong>Someone</strong> means <strong>one person</strong> but it doesnâ€™t say who.
82919	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, Tracey doesn't know who it might be.
86113	And <strong>someone </strong>often goes with the word<strong> else</strong>.
89957	<strong> Someone else </strong>means one other person.
93088	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And Tracey used other words with <strong>one</strong> in them. Listen for them in this clip.
98888	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>He always says that he couldn't love <strong>anyone</strong> except me.
103354	And <strong>everyone</strong> knows that you should trust people you love. Thereâ€™s <strong>no one</strong> else I can ask.
108888	<strong>Catherine.<br></strong>Right, so there's <strong>anyone</strong>. That also means one person, but <strong>anyone</strong> is used mostly in questions and negative sentences.
118100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Then there's <strong>everyone</strong>: <strong>Everyone</strong> means all people.
122300	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>no one</strong>. There's no one else I can ask. Notice the word <strong>else</strong> again,.
128333	<strong>No one else</strong> means <strong>no other person</strong>. You can also say <strong>anyone else.
134512	Or <strong>everyone else</strong>. That means <strong>all other people</strong>.
138719	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, in written English,<strong> someone</strong>,<strong> anyone </strong>and<strong> everyone </strong>are all one word but <strong>no one </strong>is two words: <strong>no</strong> and <strong>one.
149777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. And <strong>somebody</strong>,<strong> anybody</strong>,<strong> everybody</strong> and <strong>nobody</strong> are used in exactly the same way as <strong>someone</strong>, <strong>anyone</strong> and the others.
160389	But <strong>nobody</strong> is one word. So that's different from <strong>no one</strong>.
166200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Let's have another clip.
167666	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>But do you think I should say <strong>something</strong> to him?
171293	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So this time we heard <strong>something</strong>.
173888	And of course we can also have <strong>anything</strong>,<strong> everything </strong>and <strong>nothing</strong>.
178000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And something means:<strong> one thing</strong>.
181100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Anything </strong>and<strong> everything</strong>mean<strong> all things</strong>.
184222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And<strong> nothing </strong>means -<strong> no thing</strong>.
187319	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Now let's look at the verbs we use with all these words.
191333	Tracey said: <strong>there's someone else</strong> and <strong>everyone knows</strong>.
196172	<strong>Finn<br></strong>She did. The interesting thing here is that they're singular verbs: <strong>is</strong> and <strong>knows</strong>.
203639	We always always use a singular verb with these words. And what about the verb with <strong>no one</strong> and <strong>nothing</strong>?
210666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Like in the sentence:<strong> There's no one else I can askâ€¦</strong>
214666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right, it's a singular verb again. We say <strong>there is</strong> not <strong>there are</strong>.
221076	And notice that it's positive. Itâ€™s a common mistake to use a negative verb with the <strong>no</strong> words.
227174	So we donâ€™t say 'no one isnâ€™t going'.
230520	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We say <strong>no one is going</strong>. And thereâ€™s an important point to make about <strong>everyone</strong> and <strong>everybody</strong>.
237716	Even though the verb is singular, we use <strong>they</strong>,<strong> their</strong> and <strong>them</strong>.
242915	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So: <strong>Everyone says they will come to the party</strong>.
247222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. And it's the same with <strong>no one</strong> and <strong>nobody</strong>.
251096	<strong> Nobody wants to know their exam results</strong>! And now for the last clip.
255938	<strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br></strong>I mean, most evenings he could be <strong>anywhere</strong> for all I know.
261288	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now usually<strong> anywhere, anyone or anything, </strong>meanone place, person or thing.
268600	For example <strong>Is there anywhere to park the car?
271888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But here<strong> anywhere </strong>means<strong> in any place</strong>, <strong>it doesn't matter where exactly</strong>.
277706	And you can use <strong>anyone</strong> or <strong>anything</strong> in the same way.
282227	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So <strong>ask anyone</strong> means <strong>it doesn't matter who you ask</strong>.
286400	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And <strong>I'll eat anything</strong> means <strong>it doesn't matter what I eat</strong>.
290494	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
298000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right, it's quiz time! Hereâ€™s number one: Which is correct?
305824	a) Anyone knows that London is the capital of the UK.
310708	Or b) Everyone knows that London is the capital of the UK.
316014	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It's b).
317333	<strong>Finn</strong><br>That's the one! Number two: a) Are you inviting anyone other?
323537	b) Are you inviting anyone else?
327700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It's b) again.
329547	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And now number three: a) Everyone put their coats on and left.
335277	b) Everyone put on his coat and left.
339421	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s a).
340999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Very good! Well done if you got all of those right.
343927	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. We often use <strong>someone, anyone, everyone</strong> and <strong>no one</strong> before adjectives and infinitives.
353180	So <strong>Is there anything nice to eat</strong>? Or <strong>thereâ€™s nothing to eat</strong>.
358173	Try making other sentences like that with these words and write them in your notebook.
