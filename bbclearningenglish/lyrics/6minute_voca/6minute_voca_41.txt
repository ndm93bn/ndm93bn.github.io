12666	<strong>Neil <br></strong>Hi!
13555	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello!
14055	<strong>Neil <br></strong>...and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. My name is Neil, and Iâ€™m one of the presenters today.
22222	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And Iâ€™m Sophie, and Iâ€™m the other presenter. Welcome to the show!
27061	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>Did you hear that word - <strong>presenter</strong>?
30012	Today weâ€™re going to be talking about jobs, and the different kinds of English words for different jobs.
37177	Like <strong>presenter</strong>, for example.
40130	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Weâ€™ll look at some of the different ways that words for jobs can end, like the â€˜erâ€™&nbsp; at the end of <strong>presenter</strong>. These are called suffixes.
49777	<strong><br>Neil <br></strong>As usual, weâ€™ll be giving you a quiz to see how much you can rememberâ€¦
55111	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And weâ€™ll also bring you a top tip to help you learn vocabulary.
59000	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>But first, letâ€™s listen to Anna.
61777	Sheâ€™s going to tell us about the different jobs sheâ€™s had in her life so far.
67111	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: what is Annaâ€™s job now?
72777	<strong>INSERT<br>Anna<br></strong>When I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a <strong>teacher</strong>.
77001	So I spent years training as a <strong>teacher</strong>, and then I got a job in a schoolâ€¦ and I hated it!
83444	After a few months I quit. I worked for a while as a <strong>librarian</strong>, but I didnâ€™t really like that either.
91777	Finally I started writing for a small website.
95444	Now I work as a <strong>journalist</strong>, writing for newspapers and magazines.
103555	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>So, that was Anna, talking about all the jobs sheâ€™s done.
108050	And we asked: whatâ€™s Annaâ€™s job now?
111267	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>Anna is a <strong>journalist</strong> now. She writes for newspapers and magazines.
116555	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well done if you got that right. And another question: Did you catch what Annaâ€™s first job was?
123549	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>She was a <strong>teacher</strong>. Letâ€™s listen againâ€¦
127945	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></strong><strong>Anna</strong><br>When I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a <strong>teacher</strong>.
132426	So I spent years training as a <strong>teacher</strong>.
135173	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>Now, a lot of English words for jobs end with the sound â€“er, like <strong>presenter</strong> or <strong>teacher</strong>.
144684	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes, and there are two ways to spell the suffix â€“er in job names.
151222	Sometimes this is spelled e-r, in words like <strong>presenter</strong> or <strong>teacher</strong>.
158001	Or sometimes itâ€™s spelled o-r: for example, <strong>actor</strong> or <strong>translator</strong>.
165890	<strong>Neil <br></strong>So, a <strong>teacher</strong> teaches students, an <strong>actor</strong> acts in a film, a <strong>translator</strong> translates from one language to another, a <strong>train</strong> <strong>driver</strong> drives a train.
178444	Youâ€™re an <strong>actor</strong> arenâ€™t you Sophie?
181000	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes, I am, Neil. But because Iâ€™m female you can also say Iâ€™m an <strong>actress</strong>.
187368	So, there are lots of jobs that end with that e-r suffix. But now letâ€™s look at a different suffix.
196111	Can you remember what Annaâ€™s next job was, after she quit teaching? Letâ€™s listen and check.
203888	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br>Anna<br></strong> I worked for a while as a <strong>librarian</strong>, but I didnâ€™t really like that either.
209668	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>Next, Anna worked as a <strong>librarian</strong> â€“ thatâ€™s someone who works in a library.
215555	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Another suffix which we often find at the end of a word for a job is â€“ian, spelled i-a-n.
225000	Sometimes itâ€™s pronounced â€˜shunâ€™. For example, if youâ€™ve got a problem with your eyes, you might need to go to an <strong>optician</strong>.
235055	<strong>Neil <br></strong>And someone who works in politics is a <strong>politician</strong>. Ever thought of being a politician, Sophie?
243700	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I canâ€™t say I have, Neil. OK, now letâ€™s talk about one more suffix.
249517	Do you remember what Anna does now? Sheâ€™s a <strong>journalist</strong>.
255666	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>There are also quite a lot of words for jobs in English which end in â€“ist, spelled i-s-t.
264555	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>The person who greets you in an office or a hotel is a <strong>receptionist</strong>â€¦
269999	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>And a person who looks after your teeth is a <strong>dentist</strong>.
274352	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>Youâ€™re listening to BBC Learning English.
281000	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about jobs suffixes.
283966	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>Ok. Now itâ€™s quiz time! Weâ€™ve got three questions for you.
290888	First, if someone translates from one language to another, are they a) a translatist b) a translator or c) a translatician?
305346	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the answer is, b) a translator. Well done if you got that right.
311824	Second question: which job ends with the letters â€“o-r?
317014	Is it a) actor; b) teacher or c) presenter?
323101	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>And the answer is <strong>actor</strong>.
325493	<strong>Teacher</strong> and <strong>presenter</strong> end with â€“e-r. Well done if you got both of those questions right.
332777	Itâ€™s almost time for the end of the show. But before we go, thereâ€™s just time for a top tip for learning vocabulary.
339074	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>When you record a new word, donâ€™t just write the word and the translation â€“ try drawing a picture in your notebook too!
346444	<strong>Neil </strong><strong><br></strong>Yes. Drawing a picture can help you remember the word better.
350333	<strong>Sophie </strong><strong><br></strong>Thereâ€™s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.
