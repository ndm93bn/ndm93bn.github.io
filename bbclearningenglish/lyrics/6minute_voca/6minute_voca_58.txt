20329	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Catherineâ€¦
24087	<strong>Rob</strong><br>And Iâ€™m Rob. In todayâ€™s show weâ€™re going to look at a very important part of spoken and written vocabulary: silent letters.
31881	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Silent letters. Weâ€™ll look at what they are, where they appear and how to say themâ€¦
36953	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Thereâ€™ll be a quizâ€¦
38418	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And weâ€™ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
43590	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But first, letâ€™s listen to Nick. Heâ€™s at the doctorâ€™s, and itâ€™s not good news.
48648	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>No, itâ€™s not. While you listen, try and answer this question: what treatment does the<br>doctor suggest for Nick?
56747	<strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Doctor<br></strong>Take a seat. What seems to be the problem?
59230	<strong>Nick<br></strong>Itâ€™s my wrist â€“ it really hurts!
62630	<strong>Doctor<br></strong>Letâ€™s see if we can work out whatâ€™s wrong.
65216	Do you have pain anywhere else? What about your elbows and knees?
69821	<strong>Nick<br></strong>No. Theyâ€™re fine.
72796	But I canâ€™t move my thumb and I donâ€™t know why.
76171	<strong>Doctor</strong><br>Well. Have you done anything physically demanding recently?
80510	<strong>Nick</strong><br>I did play tennis yesterdayâ€¦
83361	<strong>Doctor</strong><br>Youâ€™ve probably just got a pulled muscle then.
85712	Youâ€™ll just have to rest your wrist. No playing tennis for a while I'm afraid.
90195	<strong>STING</strong>
92504	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, we asked you: what treatment did the doctor suggest for Nick?
97201	<strong>Rob</strong><br>And the answer is: he told Nick to rest his wrist.
101936	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>He did: well done if you got that right.
104122	Now, <strong>wrist</strong> â€“ thatâ€™s the bit of your body that joins your arm to your hand â€“ is an example of the vocabulary area weâ€™re looking at today â€“ and thatâ€™s words with silent letters, Rob.
115886	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes: we spell this word <strong>wrist</strong>, <strong>w-r-i-s-t</strong>, but when we say it, we donâ€™t pronounce the first letter <strong>/w/.
127355	</strong> Instead, we start with the sound from the second letter in the word, which is the letter <strong>r</strong> - pronounced <strong>/r/.
134017	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Letâ€™s listen to Nick again.
136346	<strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Nick<br></strong>Itâ€™s my wrist â€“ it really hurts!
139825	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>So we donâ€™t say <strong>w-rist</strong>: we say <strong>wrist</strong>.
145625	<strong>Wrist</strong>. Some other words that start with a silent<strong>w</strong> areâ€¦
150542	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Write: thatâ€™s <strong>w-r-i-t-e</strong>, like to write a letter, and wrong, <strong>w-r-o-n-g</strong>, meaning not correct.
162513	In fact, thereâ€™s a rule here, which is: we donâ€™t usually pronounce the <strong>w</strong> in words that begin <strong>w-r</strong>.
170340	When did you last write a letter, Catherine?
173517	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>I wrote a letter on paperâ€¦ I really donâ€™t know Rob, to be honest, itâ€™s all email for me now.
180177	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thatâ€™s a good idea, with your handwriting.
181880	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Probably.
183467	Now, Nick said another word with a silent letter:
187200	<strong>INSERT </strong><br><strong>Nick<br></strong>â€¦ but I canâ€™t move my thumb and I donâ€™t know why.
190912	<strong>Rob</strong><br>The word was<strong> know</strong>, meaning: to recognise and understand something, is spelt <strong>k-n-o-w</strong> but we donâ€™t say the letter <strong>k</strong>.
201442	So it isnâ€™t <strong>k-now</strong> but <strong>know</strong>.
204590	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Itâ€™s <strong>know</strong>.
205978	So, another rule for you: we donâ€™t normally say the <strong>k</strong> in words that begin<strong>k-n</strong>: like <strong>knee</strong>, the joint between your upper and lower leg, and <strong>knife</strong>, the tool we use to cut things.
218830	<strong>Knee</strong> and <strong>knife</strong> start with silent <strong>k</strong>.
222817	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Excellent. Now, Nick also said a word with a silent letter at the end.
228683	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>He did, itâ€™s a part of the hand: youâ€™ve got four fingers, and then the fifth one that sticks out the other way is your <strong>thumb</strong>; thatâ€™s<strong> thumb</strong> spelt <strong>Â­t-h-u-m-b</strong>, but we donâ€™t pronounce the final <strong>b</strong>.
245289	We donâ€™t say <strong>thum-b</strong> â€“ we say <strong>thumb</strong>. <strong>Thumb</strong>.
249356	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Some other words with a silent <strong>b</strong> at the end areâ€¦
254003	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br><strong>Climb</strong>, like to climb a ladder, and <strong>lamb</strong>, a baby sheep.
259201	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Do you like lamb, Catherine?
261731	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>I do like lamb! I like lambs when they are alive, I have to say, I also quite like eating them.
268442	<strong>IDENT </strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
275025	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And itâ€™s time for a quiz.
276927	Count the silent letters in these sentences. Number one.
281531	Thereâ€™s something <strong>wrong</strong> with my <strong>wrist</strong>.
284607	<strong>Rob</strong><br>And the answer is two.
287865	<strong>Wrong</strong> and <strong>wrist</strong> both begin with a silent <strong>w</strong>.
291595	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Good. Sentence number two.
293959	I donâ€™t <strong>know</strong> why my <strong>thumb</strong> hurts.
297714	<strong>Rob</strong><br>And the answer is two again.
301826	<strong>Know</strong> starts with a silent <strong>k</strong> and <strong>thumb</strong> ends with a silent <strong>b.
306336	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And the last one.
308223	No, I canâ€™t <strong>climb</strong> up there because Iâ€™ve hurt my <strong>knee</strong>.
313098	<strong>Rob</strong><strong><br></strong>Well, <strong>climb </strong>has a silent <strong>b</strong> at the end, and <strong>knee</strong> starts with a silent <strong>k</strong>.
319094	But the word<strong>no</strong> at the beginning of the sentence is the opposite of yes, so itâ€™s spelt <strong>n-o</strong>.
325299	So the answer is: there are two words with silent letters in this sentence.
330032	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Well done if you got those right.
332738	<strong>Rob</strong><br>And that brings us almost to the end of todayâ€™s programme.
336083	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Before we go, hereâ€™s todayâ€™s top tip for learning and recording vocabulary: when you learn a word, and you know it has a silent letter, mark the silent letter very clearly in your vocabulary notebook.
349359	That way you wonâ€™t forget how to say it.
351864	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thank you â€“ I know what to do now!
