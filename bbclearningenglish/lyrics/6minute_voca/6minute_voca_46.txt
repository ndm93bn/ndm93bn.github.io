13888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Rob.
18000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'm Catherine. And our topic today is weather.
22275	Now Rob, apparently, British people love to talk about the weather.
27000	Do you think that's true?
28111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Absolutely, you know me, I'm talking about it all the time.
32222	And in today's programme, we'll look at some key weather vocabulary and show you how to use it in different types of sentences.
39222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There'll be a quiz.
40444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And we'll give you a top tip to help you learn vocabulary more effectively.
47000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, on with the show! We'll start by listening to Harvey, talking about the weather where he lives.
53777	And we have a question for you at home.
56288	<strong>Rob<br></strong>The question is: what is the weather like for Harvey in spring?
61999	<strong>INSERT<br>Harvey<br></strong>I live in the north. I love it here, but the weather isn't too good.
67255	There's a lot of <strong>rain</strong> in the autumn and winter. In fact, <strong>it's raining</strong> right now.
72856	Sometimes it <strong>snows</strong> in the winter. In the spring the weather's usually quite <strong>windy</strong>.
79307	But it's lovely and <strong>sunny</strong> in summer.
87777	<strong>Rob</strong><strong><br></strong>So, that's Harvey. And we asked you about the weather in spring. What's it like?
92476	<strong>Catherine</strong><strong><br></strong>Harvey said that the weather gets quite <strong>windy</strong> in spring.
96690	<strong>Rob</strong><strong><br></strong>Well done if you got that right. And we'll talk more about windy weather later.
101667	First, let's talk about the rain! Listen to this clip
105111	<strong>INSERT<br></strong>There's a lot of <strong>rain</strong> in the autumn and winter.
108111	<strong>Catherine</strong><strong><br></strong>In this sentence, <strong>rain</strong> is a noun, so in a sentence, we can say <strong>there is a lot of rain,</strong> or we can add a main verb, for example: <strong>I like rain</strong>. Rob - how do you feel about rain?
122888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I hate rain because I like to do a lot of cycling and when it rains I get wet.
129999	But the word <strong>rain</strong> can also be a verb.
132859	For example: <strong>it rains a lot</strong> here in London; in fact, look out the window: <strong>it's raining now</strong>!
138900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It's always raining in London! And can add a letter 'y' to the end of rain to make the adjective <strong>rainy</strong>.
147888	Rob, do you use an umbrella on <strong>rainy</strong> days?
152111	<strong>R</strong><strong>ob<br></strong>No I don't, I wear a coat - more practical.
156000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>More 'blokey'!
156777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>More 'blokey', yes. &nbsp;So that's the noun - rain; the verb - rain; and the adjective - rainy.
164555	The word <strong>snow</strong> works in the same way. Listen to this another clip.
168762	<strong>INSERT<br></strong>Sometimes it <strong>snows</strong> in the winter.
170933	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Sometimes it snows in winter.</strong> The word <strong>snow</strong> there is a verb.
177027	<strong>Rob<br></strong>As a noun, we can say: <strong>sometimes there is snow.
181138	</strong><strong><br>Catherine<br></strong>Or we can add the letter <strong>'y'</strong> to make an adjective. <strong>Sometimes it's snowy</strong>.
187222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Good. Now for another clip. Here's Harvey talking about the weather in Spring.
193111	<strong>INSERT <br></strong>In the spring the weather's usually quite <strong>windy</strong>.
196555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>In the spring the weather's usually quite <strong>windy</strong>. In this sentence, <strong>windy</strong> is an adjective.
203999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We can also use the word <strong>wind</strong> as a noun. <strong>Is there much wind today</strong> Catherine?
210177	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>There's quite a lot actually, I got quite blown around.
213000	So that's <strong>wind</strong> as a noun and <strong>windy</strong> as an adjective, but we can't use <strong>wind</strong> as a verb.
223104	You have to use a different verb like <strong>blow</strong>. The wind is blowing very hard today.
230132	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Right. And the word <strong>sun</strong> is the same. It's a noun:
235111	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br><strong>The sun is hot</strong>.
236840	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>It can make an adjective:<br>
238619	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br><strong>It's lovely and sunny</strong>.
240830	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>But it isn't a verb. You need a different word for that.
244727	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br><strong>The sun is shining</strong>, even though it isn't!
248666	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
254999	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>And we're looking at weather words. OK, it's quiz time!
259286	Are these sentences correct or wrong? Number one. <strong>It's sunning today.
266259	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's wrong. You can't say <strong>it's sunning</strong>, because sun isn't a verb.
272953	Instead, say <strong>it's sunny</strong> or <strong>the sun is shining.
278111	<strong>Rob <br></strong>Number two. <strong>There was a lot of snow last week.
282720	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's correct.
284222	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Here comes the last one. <strong>I don't like windy.
288545	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And that's also wrong.
290695	<strong> Windy </strong>is an adjective, so we need to add a noun here. Say: <strong>I don't like windy weather.
298777	Or, use<strong> wind </strong>as a noun and say:<strong> I don't like wind.
304444	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got those right.
311333	And we've just got time for a top tip for learning vocabulary.
315999	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>We have Rob, and this is it: when you learn a new word for the first time, you'll learn it more effectively if you use it a few times in the first 24 hours.
326111	So, if you learn a new word in the morning Rob, look it up again in the evening before you go to sleep.
332555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I'll do that. Thank you! There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.
338777	Join us again soon for more 6 Minute Vocabulary.
342237	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!
