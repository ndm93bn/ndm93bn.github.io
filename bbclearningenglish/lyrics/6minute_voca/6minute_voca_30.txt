12999	<strong>Rob <br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Rob, and this is Catherine.
18129	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hi! Today we've got a <strong>fantastic</strong> programme for you. It's all about <strong>strong adjectives.
27477	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, it is. We'll give you a <strong>wonderful</strong> explanation of what they are and how to use them.
33009	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We'll also give you some very useful advice on how to use intensifiers with adjectives.
39333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And there'll be a <strong>fabulous</strong> quiz.
41333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And finally we'll give you an absolutely <strong>amazing</strong> tip to help you learn vocabulary.
46599	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Wow. OK, let's get going then, there's no time to waste.
49320	Here's Tom. Now, he took his girlfriend to the cinema and then for dinner afterwards. Very romantic!
55798	Let's hear how the evening went. While you're listening, try to answer this question: was it a successful evening out?
66000	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Tom<br></strong>We went to see that new film - I thought it was <strong>quite funny</strong>, but Jenny thought it was <strong>hilarious</strong>.
72400	We went for a meal: The food was <strong>not so bad</strong> but the service was <strong>absolutely terrible</strong>!
78200	We waited nearly an hour to get our food. When it finally arrived, I was <strong>absolutely starving</strong>!
88100	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So - the meal didn't go too well: Tom and Jenny had to wait a long time for their food - nearly an hour! What do you think about that Catherine?
97111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I wouldn't last that long. Twenty minutes, and I'd be gone.
100299	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, luckily, they liked the film. Listen to this clip:
103777	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br></strong>I thought it was <strong>quite funny</strong>, but Jenny thought it was <strong>hilarious</strong>.
108000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Tom said he thought the film was <strong>quite funny</strong>.
111275	<strong>Quite funny</strong>. Now, when we use an ordinary adjective, like <strong>funny</strong>, we can add a word like <strong>quite</strong>, or <strong>very</strong>, or <strong>just a little bit</strong>, to give more information about the adjective.
124222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, we can say the film was <strong>quite funny,</strong> or <strong>very funny</strong>, or <strong>just a little bit funny</strong>.
131278	These words are called intensifiers - and they are <strong>quite useful</strong>.
135559	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>They're <strong>very useful </strong>actually.
137700	Yes. So Tom thought the film was funny; but Jenny thought it was <strong>hilarious</strong>.
144000	And the word <strong>hilarious</strong> means - very, very funny.
147800	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Hilarious</strong> is a special kind of adjective - it already includes the idea of <strong>very.
154333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, and we call this type of adjective a strong adjective, and there are lots of them.
160200	For example, to mean <strong>very good,</strong> we can say:
164000	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Wonderful! Fabulous! Amazing!
167333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you Rob. Three <strong>fantastic</strong> words there.
170026	But most of the time, we don't use intensifiers like <strong>quite</strong>, or <strong>very</strong>, or <strong>just a little bit with</strong> these strong adjectives, and that's because the idea of <strong>very</strong> is already in the word.
183900	So for example, <strong>hilarious</strong> means <strong>very funny</strong>, so <strong>a little bit hilarious</strong> would mean <strong>a little bit very funny</strong>, and that doesn't make sense, does it Rob?
195666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Absolutely not, no. OK, well back to the clip.
198299	Tom used a couple of other strong adjectives, too.
201555	Listen again. What's the strong adjective?
204800	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>The food was <strong>not so bad</strong> but the service was <strong>absolutely terrible</strong>!
209925	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, Tom used the ordinary adjective <strong>bad</strong>, and he used it with an intensifier when he said <strong>not so bad.
218123	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But the strong adjective was <strong>terrible</strong>.
221317	<strong>Terrible </strong>means <strong>very bad</strong>.
223478	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And this time, Tom used an intensifier that we usually only use with strong adjectives - he said it was <strong>absolutely terrible.
234126	So, when we want to make a strong adjective even stronger, we need to use one of these special intensifiers, like <strong>absolutely</strong>.
243101	So, we say <strong>very bad</strong>, but we say <strong>absolutely terrible</strong>.
248822	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And we don't usually say <strong>absolutely bad</strong>.
253000	Here's Tom using another strong adjective. Listen carefully, and see if you can catch it!
258999	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br></strong>We waited for nearly an hour to get our food.
262147	When it finally arrived, I was <strong>absolutely starving</strong>!
265854	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Tom used the phrase <strong>absolutely starving</strong>.
269655	<strong>Starving</strong> is a strong adjective, which means <strong>very hungry</strong>, and he used the intensifier <strong>absolutely</strong> to make it even stronger. <strong>Absolutely starving</strong>.
