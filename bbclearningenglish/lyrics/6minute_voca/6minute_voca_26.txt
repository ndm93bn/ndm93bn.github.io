12100	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Catherineâ€¦
15860	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And Iâ€™m Finn. Today weâ€™re talking about suffixes.
19855	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>A suffix is a group of letters at the end of a word, which can tell you what kind of word it is.
26400	In todayâ€™s programme weâ€™re looking at <strong>-ment, </strong>spelt<strong> m-e-n-t, -ance</strong> spelt<strong> a-n-c-e, </strong>and <strong>-ence, </strong>spelt <strong>e-n-c-e</strong>.
39500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>The last two sound quite similar, don't they?
42088	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>They do.
42788	<strong>Finn</strong><br><strong>-ance</strong> and <strong>-ence</strong>. But first, letâ€™s hear from Tania.
48100	She loves to dance. Sheâ€™s talking about her recent visit to the ballet.
53415	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. While you listen, think about this question: Did Tania enjoy the ballet in the end?
60444	<strong>INSERT<br></strong>There was huge <strong>excitement</strong> in the audience. This was the Bolshoiâ€™s only <strong>performance</strong> of Swan Lake in London.
68444	But at half past seven a man appeared and made an <strong>announcement</strong>.
73314	He thanked us for our <strong>patience</strong> and then said that the lead dancer was ill and couldnâ€™t <strong>perform</strong>.
80555	In the <strong>silence</strong> that followed, you could feel everyoneâ€™s <strong>disappointment</strong>. But the <strong>replacement </strong>dancer was wonderful.
89769	She wasnâ€™t too <strong>confident</strong> to start with, but her <strong>confidence</strong> grew and, in the end, the lead dancerâ€™s <strong>absence</strong> didnâ€™t lessen my <strong>enjoyment </strong>at all.
101742	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So we asked you: Did Tania enjoy the ballet in the end?
106755	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer was: Yes, she did. The lead dancerâ€™s <strong>absence</strong> didnâ€™t lessen her <strong>enjoyment.
115484	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>absence</strong> and <strong>enjoyment</strong> are two key words in this programme.
121000	The noun <strong>absence</strong> with the suffix <strong>-ence</strong>, spelt <strong>e-n-c-e,</strong> means someone or something not being there.
130222	It comes from the adjective <strong>absent</strong>.
133000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦and the noun <strong>enjoyment</strong> with the suffix <strong>-ment</strong> comes from the verb <strong>enjoy</strong>.
139792	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Letâ€™s listen to a clip with more words with <strong>-ment</strong> and <strong>-ence, </strong>spelt<strong> e-n-c-e</strong>.
148125	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>In the <strong>silence</strong> that followed, you could feel everyoneâ€™s <strong>disappointment</strong>.
152934	But the <strong>replacement </strong>dancer was wonderful. She wasnâ€™t too <strong>confident</strong> to start with, but her <strong>confidence</strong> grew.
161434	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we had two nouns with the suffix <strong>-ence</strong>,spelt<strong> e-n-c-e</strong>:<strong> silence</strong> and <strong>confidence</strong>.
171222	The noun <strong>silence</strong> comes from the adjective <strong>silent</strong>,meaning complete quiet.
177070	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and the noun <strong>confidence</strong>, which comes from the adjective <strong>confident</strong>, means having belief in your own abilities.
184800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Notice that both adjectives end in the letter <strong>t</strong>, which changes to a letter <strong>c</strong> in the suffix <strong>-</strong><strong>ence</strong>.
193813	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So<strong> silent</strong> becomes <strong>sil-ence</strong>â€¦
197600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦and <strong>confident</strong> becomes <strong>confid-ence</strong>.
201594	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Other common adjectives ending in the letter <strong>t</strong> that add <strong>e-n-c-e</strong> are: <strong>independent </strong>and<strong> different</strong>â€¦
209860	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦which become <strong>independence </strong>and<strong> difference.
214099	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>In the clip, we also heard two more words with the suffix <strong>-ment</strong>.
219050	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, we heard <strong>disappointment, </strong>which comes from the verb <strong>disappoint</strong>, meaning a feeling of being unhappy because you have been let down.
228508	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and <strong>replacement</strong>, which comes from the verb <strong>replace</strong> and means a thing or person which takes the place of something or someone else.
238430	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, letâ€™s hear another clip. Listen out for two words with the suffixes<strong> -ance</strong> with an <strong>a</strong> and <strong>-ence </strong>with an <strong>e</strong>.
247777	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>There was huge <strong>excitement</strong> in the audience.
250938	This was the Bolshoiâ€™s only <strong>performance</strong> of Swan Lake in London.
255555	But at half past seven a man appeared and made an <strong>announcement</strong>.
260469	He thanked us for our <strong>patience</strong> and then said that the lead dancer was ill and couldnâ€™t perform.
268333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we had the noun <strong>performance</strong>, spelt <strong>a-n-c-e </strong>at the end, which comes from the verb <strong>perform</strong>.
276826	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we had <strong>patience</strong>, spelt<strong> e-n-c-e </strong>at the end, from the adjective <strong>patient</strong>.
283128	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Did you spot the two words with the suffix <strong>â€“ment</strong>?
287790	<strong>Excitement </strong>from the verb <strong>excite</strong>â€¦
290874	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and <strong>announcement </strong>from the verb <strong>announce</strong>.

300649	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, time for a quiz. And ready for number one?
304439	Is the word <strong>silence</strong> spelt a) s-i-l-e-n-c-e or b) s-i-l-a-n-c-e?
317100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Itâ€™s a) s-i-l-e-n-c-e.
322216	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very good. Number two: Whatâ€™s the noun that comes from the verb <strong>replace?
329000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It's <strong>replacement.
331800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And, number three: Complete this sentence: Maria lacks a) confident or b) confidence?
341066	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It's b)<strong> confidence.</strong>And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.
348000	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And now, hereâ€™s todayâ€™s top tip for learning vocabulary: choose a word and then think of all the different forms of that word, so think of a noun, adjective and verb all with the same root.
