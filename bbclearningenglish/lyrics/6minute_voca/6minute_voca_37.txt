1	(Introduction...)
14111	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Callum.
17833	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And me Finn. Today weâ€™re talking about words like Hoover and Xerox, which started as brand names of particular products, but now are often used to refer to other similar products.
30666	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>And some of them are also used as verbs. Words like these are called eponyms.
36600	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>There will be a quiz; and of course weâ€™ll bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.
43837	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>But first letâ€™s listen to Cath. Sheâ€™s chatting a bit about brand names that have become part of the language.
51666	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And listen out for the answer to this question: how does Cath say <strong>do you use Facebook</strong>?
58777	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Cath<br></strong>â€˜Iâ€™ll <strong>google</strong> it.â€™
60555	How many times a day do you think or say that?
64549	<strong>Google</strong> is the number one search engine today and people sometimes talk about <strong>googling</strong> even when theyâ€™re using a different search engine, like Bing or Yahoo.
75111	In the same way <strong>Facebook</strong> is number one for social networking and <strong>Skype</strong> for web chats.
81454	So do you <strong>facebook</strong> or <strong>skype</strong> your friends?
85000	And how often do you <strong>xerox</strong> a document or go <strong>rollerblading</strong>?
95888	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Right, that was Cath. And we asked: how does she say <strong>do you use Facebook</strong>?
103555	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And the answer is she said<strong> â€˜do you facebook your friends?â€™</strong>
108402	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Thatâ€™s right. Cath uses <strong>facebook</strong> as a verb because <strong>Facebook</strong> has become so much a part of our lives that we need a verb to talk about using it.
117630	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So thatâ€™s a bit like using the word <strong>Hoover</strong>, isnâ€™t it?
120999	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Exactly. Until the middle of the twentieth century, the <strong>Hoover</strong> brand was the biggest name among vacuum cleaners.
129400	Thatâ€™s why we say that we <strong>hoover</strong> our carpets.
132444	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>But today that means â€˜use any vacuum cleanerâ€™, doesnâ€™t it? Not just the <strong>Hoover</strong> brand.
138555	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>It does. So in fact thatâ€™s a bit different from the verb to <strong>facebook</strong>. Because that only means to use the <strong>Facebook</strong> site.
147332	But who knows? It might change and be used more generally in the future to refer to other social media sites. Now letâ€™s have our first clip?
156098	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP<br> </strong>â€˜Iâ€™ll <strong>google</strong> it.â€™ How many times a day do you think or say that?
161888	<strong>Google</strong> is the number one search engine today and people sometimes talk about <strong>googling</strong> even when theyâ€™re using a different search engine like Bing or Yahoo.
172300	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So, thatâ€™s another example, a bit like <strong>Hoover</strong>.
175300	Thereâ€™s the verb to <strong>google</strong>, the brand name <strong>Google</strong>, and the noun <strong>googling</strong> to talk about the activity of using <strong>Google</strong>.
183444	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes, and like <strong>hoover </strong>and<strong> hoovering </strong>are good for other vacuum cleaner brands, people can be using any search engine when they use the verb <strong>google</strong> and the noun <strong>googling</strong>.
194222	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Now, one thing to remember is that trademark names like <strong>Google, Facebook</strong> and <strong>Hoover</strong> should have a capital letter.
202200	But the verbs and nouns that come from these names donâ€™t.
205900	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Mmm. On to clip 2.
207922	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>In the same way <strong>Facebook</strong> is number one for social networking and <strong>Skype</strong> for web chats.
214400	So do you <strong>facebook</strong> or <strong>skype</strong> your friends?
217955	And how often do you <strong>xerox</strong> a document or go <strong>rollerblading</strong>?
222624	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So, Callum, what do we do when we use <strong>Skype</strong>?
226564	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Well, we <strong>skype</strong>!
228333	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>We do. <strong>Skyping</strong> is a popular way to contact friends and business colleagues around the world.
234978	And this software has given up this new verb, <strong>to skype.</strong>
239508	And then Cath threw in another couple of examples with this type of word, didnâ€™t she?
245777	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes, she talked about <strong>xeroxing</strong> a document.
249000	<strong>Xerox </strong>is often used to mean <strong>photocopy</strong>, both noun and verb, and it comes from the company <strong>Xerox</strong>, which produced the first plain paper photocopier.
258300	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>But we should mention that this is an American English expression. Itâ€™s not one we use very often in British English.
265878	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>She also mentioned going <strong>rollerblading</strong>.
268855	<strong>Rollerblade</strong> is a brand of inline skates that became so popular that we now have the verb to <strong>rollerblade</strong> and the noun <strong>rollerblading</strong>.
278555	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And today theyâ€™re used whatever brand of inline skates weâ€™re using.
283247	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Other common words like these are <strong>Kleenex</strong> meaning any kind of paper tissue and <strong>Aspirin</strong> for painkillers.
289777	But they donâ€™t have verbs to go with them.
292171	<strong>IDENT</strong><br> Youâ€™re listening to BBC Learning English.
297555	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>And weâ€™re talking about eponyms as nouns and verbs.
301444	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And time for the quiz! Number one: How else can I say <strong>do the vacuuming</strong>?
308922	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Itâ€™s <strong>do the hoovering</strong>.
311208	<strong>Finn</strong><br> It is! Number two: Whatâ€™s another way of saying: <strong>I often talk to my friends on Skype</strong>?
319653	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Itâ€™s <strong>I often skype my friends</strong>.
323000	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Excellent! Number three: What does: <strong>Would you like a Kleenex</strong> mean?
329222	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>It means: <strong>Would you like a tissue</strong>?
332358	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>That's correct! And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz.
335666	<strong>Facebook</strong> your friends if you got them all right!
338333	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>But before we go, hereâ€™s todayâ€™s top tip.
341444	If the name of an object has a capital letter, itâ€™s probably because itâ€™s an eponym from a brand.
347999	Look it up in a dictionary, where it should be labelled â€˜trademarkâ€™, and check whether there are useful verbs or nouns that come from it.
355444	Practise making new sentences with those words.
