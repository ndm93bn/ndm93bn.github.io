15900	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Hello and welcome to this episode of 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Finn.
21222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>...and I'm Feifei. Hi!
23190	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Today we're going to be talking about contractions, like <strong>I've</strong> meaning I have, or <strong>isn't</strong> meaning is not.
33567	We're going to talk about what these contractions mean, and how to pronounce them.
38222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>That's right, and learning to use contractions like <strong>I've</strong> or <strong>isn't</strong> when youâ€™re speaking will make your English sound much more fluent and natural.
47666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And that's got to be good news. As usual, we'll have lots of examples.
52555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>There'll be a short quiz.
54111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And finally we'll give you a tip to help you with your vocabulary studies.
62111	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So, let's start with an example. Listen to Bill talking about his wife and his brother.
69666	<strong>Finn <br></strong>While you're listening, try to answer this question: has Bill's brother ever visited the US?
77333	<strong>INSERT<br>Bill<br></strong>My wife and I live in London. <strong>We've</strong> been married for about five years.
82333	<strong>I've</strong> always lived in London, but <strong>s</strong><strong>he's</strong> lived in Germany, and the US, and lots of different places.
88222	<strong>I've</strong> never been to the US, but my <strong>brother's</strong> been there many times, because his wife is from New York.
94777	<strong>Finn <br></strong>So, Feifei asked you: has Bill's brother ever visited the US?
100350	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And the answer is yes, Bill's brother has been to the US many times, because his wife is American. She's from New York.
109888	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Did you get the answer right? Of course you did!
112669	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Ok, now here is another question. How long have Bill and his wife been married? Listen again and check.
119999	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br></strong>My wife and I live in London. <strong>We've</strong> been married for about five years.
125666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>He said 'We've been married for about five years'.
129863	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Did you notice that he didn't say <strong>we have been</strong>, he said <strong>we've been</strong>?
136000	When we're speaking, we often shorten the word <strong>have</strong>, and just say <strong>-ve</strong> instead.
142222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So I have becomes <strong>I've</strong>, you have becomes <strong>you've</strong>, we have becomes <strong>we've</strong> and they have becomes <strong>they've</strong>.
153111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We use contractions like <strong>we've</strong> a lot when we're speaking, but sometimes we write them, too - especially when we're writing something informal or unofficial, like an email or a postcard.
166193	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Now, when you're writing contractions, remember to use an apostrophe.
171284	So, for example, <strong>we've</strong> is spelled <strong>w</strong> - <strong>e</strong> - apostrophe - <strong>v</strong> - <strong>e</strong>.
178395	<strong>Finn<br></strong>The apostrophe shows that a letter, or more than one, is missing.
182999	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>That's right, so when we write <strong>we've</strong> instead of <strong>we have</strong>, we miss the letters h and a from the word 'have'.
191666	And the apostrophe shows that these letters have been skipped.
195600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right, ok. Here's another question about Bill.
199035	How many different places has his wife lived in? Can you remember? Here's a clip.
206446	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong><strong>Bill<br></strong>I've always lived in London, but she's lived in Germany, and the US, and lots of different places.
212333	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>He said that she's lived in lots of different places.
216316	And he mentioned two of them: Germany, and the US.
220444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Did you notice another contraction there?
223666	Bill said <strong>s</strong><strong>he's lived</strong>.
226333	It's the short form of she has lived. <strong>She's lived</strong>.
230651	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>This is a very common one. Instead of <strong>has</strong>, lots of English speakers say <strong>-'s /z/</strong> instead.
237222	<strong>Finn <br></strong>So instead of <strong>he has</strong> we say <strong>he's</strong>, instead of <strong>she has</strong> it's <strong>she's</strong>.
245000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Again, when you use this -<strong>'s</strong> <strong>/z/</strong> contraction instead of has when you're writing, don't forget to use the apostrophe.
252600	<strong>Finn <br></strong>So, <strong>he's</strong> is spelled <strong>h</strong> - <strong>e</strong> - <strong>apostrophe</strong> - <strong>s</strong>, and <strong>she's</strong> is spelled <strong>s</strong> - <strong>h</strong> -<strong> e</strong> - <strong>apostrophe</strong> - <strong>s</strong>.
263279	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.com
269777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And now it's time for a quiz. Number one.
275504	When we're speaking, we don't normally say 'I have lived here for three years' - what do we say?
283111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We say, 'I've lived here for three years'.
287111	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Easy question, right?
288222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I think so.
289017	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Here's another one: Which pronunciation is correct?
292777	Is it a) <strong>He's</strong> <strong>/s/</strong> a teacher or is it b) <strong>He's /z/ </strong>a teacher?
298666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It's b) He's /z/ a teacher. And one last question.
305333	In the sentence <strong>We've been listening to 6 Minute Vocabulary</strong>, how do you spell <strong>we've</strong>?
314222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>It's <strong>w - e - apostrophe - v - e.
319177	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's it. Before we go, here's a top tip to help you learn vocabulary.
324420	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Vocabulary learning isn't a silent activity!
328777	You'll learn words more effectively if you say them out loud.
333055	It doesn't matter if nobody's listening - say the words out loud anyway!
338333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Absolutely. Very good. Thereâ€™s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.
