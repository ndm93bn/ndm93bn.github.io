13000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finnâ€¦
17950	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me Catherine. Today weâ€™re talking about short spoken forms.
25980	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's words like <strong>gonna</strong>, <strong>wanna</strong> and <strong>gotta</strong> that we use a lot in spoken English.
36000	Letâ€™s start by listening to Jason and Yuki talking about their plans for the weekend.
42500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And hereâ€™s a question: Whoâ€™s Yuki meeting on Saturday night? Have a listen.
48824	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Jason<br></strong><strong>Whatcha </strong>doing at the weekend, Yuki?
51800	<strong>Yuki<br></strong>I<strong> dunno.</strong> Iâ€™m probably<strong> gonna </strong>meet Lucy on Saturday night.
56040	<strong>Jason<br></strong>Oh, right. Do you<strong> wanna </strong>come to the cinema in the afternoon?
60500	<strong>Yuki<br></strong>No, thanks. Iâ€™ve<strong> gotta </strong>finish an English essay for Monday morning.
64950	<strong>Jason<br></strong>OK. <strong>Lemme</strong> know if you change your mind.
68865	<strong>STING</strong>
71666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well that was Jason and Yuki. We asked you: Whoâ€™s Yuki meeting on Saturday night?
78000	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And the answer is: sheâ€™s probably going to meet Lucy.
81444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. But instead of saying <strong>going to</strong>, Yuki said <strong>gonna</strong>.
87333	<strong>Sheâ€™s probably gonna meet Lucy</strong>.
89777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re looking at in this programme.
93200	English speakers often say the words<strong> going to </strong>very fast â€“ and it sounds like<strong> gonna.
101354	</strong>They usually do this in informal situations when theyâ€™re talking to friends.
106177	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So does that mean that you shouldnâ€™t say <strong>gonna</strong> when you need to speak carefully and politely, like in a job interview?
115444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, not necessarily. If <strong>gonna</strong> comes out naturally, itâ€™s probably ok.
121300	But a job interview is formal, so itâ€™s probably&nbsp;a bit more polite to say <strong>going to</strong>.
128160	And you donâ€™t usually use <strong>gonna</strong> in writing, unless youâ€™re actually writing down a dialogue.
134600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In fact some people never use it, even informally. Although itâ€™s probably more common in American English.
143000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. And one other thing about <strong>gonna</strong> is that we only use it to replace <strong>going to</strong> when itâ€™s followed by a verb.
152500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's true. If you say: <strong>Iâ€™m going to Paris</strong>, you canâ€™t use <strong>gonna</strong> to say: Iâ€™m <strong>gonna</strong> Paris.
161000	Youâ€™d have to add a verb, like this, and say: <strong>Iâ€™m gonna go to Paris</strong>.
166100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>I'm gonna go to Paris</strong>.
167660	Letâ€™s have another clip with some more short spoken forms.
172970	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong><strong>Jason<br>Whatcha </strong>doing at the weekend, Yuki?
175758	<strong>Yuki<br></strong>I<strong> dunno. </strong>Iâ€™m probably<strong> gonna </strong>meet Lucy on Saturday night.
180451	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So Jason said <strong>whatcha</strong>. <strong>Whatcha</strong>.
185822	Thatâ€™s a short form of <strong>what are you</strong>. Or sometimes <strong>what do you</strong>.
191000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And Yuki said <strong>I dunno</strong>. <strong>I dunno</strong>.
195300	Thatâ€™s a short spoken form of <strong>I donâ€™t know</strong>.
198900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Letâ€™s have another clip. See if you can spot any more.
202600	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong><strong>Jason<br></strong>Oh, right. Do you<strong> wanna </strong>come to the cinema in the afternoon?
207450	<strong>Yuki<br></strong>No, thanks. Iâ€™ve<strong> gotta </strong>finish an English essay for Monday morning.
212000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Did you get them? We heard <strong>wanna</strong>.
216555	Thatâ€™s a short form of <strong>want to</strong>.
219044	<strong>Do you wanna come to the cinema in the afternoon</strong>?
221700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And there was also <strong>gotta</strong>. <strong>Gotta</strong>.
225800	<strong> Iâ€™ve</strong><strong> gotta finish an English essay</strong>.
228866	Here, <strong>gotta</strong> is short for <strong>got to</strong>.
232400	But <strong>gotta</strong> can also be short for the possessive <strong>got a</strong>, like in <strong>Iâ€™ve gotta new mobile</strong>.
240566	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now for the last clip.
244000	<strong>INSERT CLIP 3<br></strong><strong>Jason<br></strong>OK. <strong>Lemme</strong> know if you change your mind.
246396	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Can you guess what <strong>lemme</strong> is short for?
249708	Itâ€™s <strong>let me. Let me know if you change your mind.
254066	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. And there are others like <strong>hafta</strong>,<strong> hafta</strong>, for <strong>have to</strong> or <strong>gimme</strong>, that's <strong>gimme</strong>, for <strong>give me</strong>.
266800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now what about <strong>kinda</strong>, <strong>kinda</strong>, for <strong>kind of</strong>?
272700	Like <strong>Sheâ€™s kinda nice</strong>.
275048	<strong>IDENT</strong>&nbsp; <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
281904	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about spoken short forms.
286100	So Catherine, <strong>whatcha gonna</strong> do in the quiz?
291105	<strong>Catherine<br></strong> Quiz question number one: whatâ€™s a more informal way to say <strong>Iâ€™ve got to phone the bank</strong>?
299222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Itâ€™s <strong>Iâ€™ve gotta phone the bank</strong>.
302907	<strong>Catherine<br></strong> And number two: you want to know what your friend is doing tonight.
308200	How can you ask them, using a spoken short form?
311800	<strong>Finn</strong><br>You could say: <strong>whatcha doing tonight</strong>?
315300	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And number three: you think itâ€™s going to rain.
319500	Tell your friend using a spoken short form.
323633	<strong>Finn</strong><br>You could say:<strong> I think itâ€™s gonna rain</strong>.
327552	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.
332069	Now before we go, hereâ€™s a vocabulary tip. Try to watch TV, movies and video clips regularly in English.
