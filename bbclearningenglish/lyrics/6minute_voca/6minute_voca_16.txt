1	(Introducion...)
14000	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherine.
17483	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And I'm Neil. Oh. Catherine.
24068	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah.
25079	<strong>Neil<br></strong>A present?
25955	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes.
26791	<strong>Neil<br></strong>How kind. It's not even my birthday.
30302	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I know, Neil. But every day's a present day in Learning English.
33855	Actually, I bought it because the word present is a key word for the topic we're going to present in this programme.
41251	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah. PREsent and preSENT.
45546	They are spelt same way but we say them differently.
48962	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, because today weâ€™re talking about words that are spelt the same, but pronounced differently, depending on whether weâ€™re using them as nouns or verbs.
58960	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Like PREsent and preSENT. So the present you gave me is the noun.
64827	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. And weâ€™re presenting 6 Minute Vocabulary â€“ present here is a verb.
71126	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Weâ€™ll be giving you more examplesâ€¦
72994	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And weâ€™ll have a quiz, so listen carefully â€¦
75274	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And weâ€™ll also bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.
79297	And Iâ€™ve got an invite for Catherine to my partyâ€¦
83723	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s not even your birthday.
85407	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Itâ€™s my birthday every day.
87164	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Iâ€™ll come to your party then.
89512	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, more about that invite laterâ€¦
91944	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But first, letâ€™s hear Lucy talking about Sam Smith, her favourite singer.
97078	Neil: Sam Smith. Are you a fan?
99152	<strong>Neil</strong><br>I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™m a fan, but Iâ€™m aware of his work.
102049	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Oh good.
103341	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Anyway, hereâ€™s Lucy. And she is a big Sam Smith fan.
107005	Think about this question while you listen: Will the number of people who want to go to his concerts go up, or down?
115408	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Lucy<br></strong>I really want to go to a Sam Smith concert but the tickets have already sold out.
120988	Sometimes when that happens, they increase the number of concert dates.
125544	I want to hear him sing 'Stay with me' â€“ it won 'Record of the Year' at the Grammys.
130795	I hope heâ€™ll record some new songs soon.
133144	But that will mean an increase in people wanting concert tickets.
138374	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So we asked you: Will the number of people who want to go to Sam Smith concerts go up, or will it go down?
145706	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is: it will go up.
148637	Lucy says there will be an increase in people wanting concert tickets.
153873	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and increase here is a noun, so the stress is on the first syllable: INcrease.
160907	But Lucy also used the same word as a verb.
164658	Listen to this clip. Where does the stress fall this time?
169228	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>Sometimes when that happens, they increase the number of concert dates.
174067	<strong>Neil<br></strong>This time, the stress falls on the second syllable â€“ inCREASE, because Lucyâ€™s using the word as a verb.
181751	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Other nouns and verbs with the same spelling move the stress from the first to second syllable in the same way - like the noun DEcreaseâ€¦
190737	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦which becomes deCREASE, when itâ€™s a verb.
193790	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and there is, of course Neil, the INvite you gave me to your partyâ€¦
197982	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, INvite here is a noun with the stress on the first syllable.
202169	But if I say to Catherine, I want to inVITE you to my party on Saturday, inVITE is a verb, with the stress falling on the second syllableâ€¦ Donâ€™t worry Catherine â€“ I havenâ€™t forgottenâ€¦
214022	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Nor have I, Neil! Looking forward to it.
217020	And hereâ€™s another clip from Lucy.
219371	Listen out for another word she uses as a noun and a verb with different stress patterns.
226366	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1</strong>
226366	I want to hear him sing 'Stay with me' â€“ it won â€˜REcord of the Yearâ€™ at the Grammys.
231739	I hope heâ€™ll reCORD some new songs soon.
234121	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We had REcord and reCORD.
236951	REcord is the noun, so the stress is on the first syllable.
241673	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦And reCORD is the verb, so the stress is on the second syllable.
246569	<strong>IDENT</strong><br>6 Minute Vocabulary, from BBC Learning English.
254403	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Weâ€™re talking about nouns and verbs that are spelt the same but pronounced differently, like a REcord and to reCORD.
262809	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we stress the first syllable when the word is a noun, and the second syllable when the word is a verb.
269352	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And now, itâ€™s time for a quiz, so get ready!
275665	Which is the correct way to say the missing word in these sentences?
281355	Number one: Michael Phelps has the [sfx: bell] for the most Olympic gold medals.
290664	Is it a) reCORD or b) REcord?
296106	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Itâ€™s REcord because itâ€™s a noun.
298803	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Well done if you got that right.
300597	Number two: We hope that sales will [sfx: bell] this month.
307720	Is it a) INcrease or b) InCREASE?
312958	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And the answer is b) InCREASE because itâ€™s a verb.
316732	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And finally, number three: I need to buy a [sfx: bell] for my friends.
324053	Theyâ€™re getting married tomorrow.
325896	Is it a) PREsent or b) preSENT?
331113	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Itâ€™s a) PREsent because itâ€™s a noun.
335074	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz â€“ well done if you got them right.
338809	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And itâ€™s almost the end of the programme.
341123	<strong>Neil</strong><br>But before we go, hereâ€™s todayâ€™s top tip for learning vocabulary: when you look up a word in an online dictionary, listen to the audio and try to copy the word stress.
352250	If possible, record yourself saying the word, then compare your pronunciation with the audio from the dictionary.
