12019	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil.
15700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'm Catherine. In this show we're talking about uncountable nouns.
21333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, we are. So that's nouns that you canâ€™t count, like <strong>water</strong>, <strong>money</strong> and <strong>research</strong>. We'll show you plenty of examples.
30900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...and we'll also bring you a top tip for recognising uncountable nouns.
35774	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But let's start by listening to Colin. He's a travel agent.
40610	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: what might you need from your bank before you go abroad? Here's Colin.
47700	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Colin<br></strong>It's time to start planning your summer <strong>travel</strong>!
51400	Do some <strong>research</strong> before you go. Are there good reviews of the <strong>accommodation</strong>?
56608	How much <strong>baggage</strong> can you take and what's the best way to take <strong>money </strong>abroad?
62800	Do you need to get some <strong>advice</strong> from your bank? Will the <strong>traffic</strong> be bad on the way to the airport?
72106	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So that was Colin. We asked you: What might you need from your bank before you go abroad?
79600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: You might need some <strong>advice</strong>.
83100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right: <strong>some advice</strong>.
84955	<strong> Advice</strong> means ideas and suggestions about what to do. Now, did you notice that <strong>advice </strong>is not plural?
92950	We never say <strong>advices</strong> in English because <strong>advice</strong> is an uncountable noun.
99000	You can't make <strong>advice</strong> plural, like you can in some other languages.
103409	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And with uncountable nouns, we don't use articles <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong>.
108500	We say <strong>some advice</strong>, not<strong> an advice</strong>. Now listen out for three more uncountable nouns in this clip.
116800	<strong>INSERT<br>Colin<br></strong>It's time to start planning your summer <strong>travel</strong>!
120300	Do some <strong>research</strong> before you go.
122755	Are there good reviews of the <strong>accommodation</strong>?
125700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the uncountable nouns in that clip were: <strong>travel, research</strong> and <strong>accommodation</strong>.
132400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And activities like <strong>travel, work</strong> and <strong>homework</strong> are usually uncountable.
138700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Information words like <strong>research</strong>,<strong> information</strong> and <strong>advice</strong> are uncountable too.
144900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, they're not usually plural in English, but we can add the words <strong>a piece of </strong>to lots of uncountable nouns if we like.
153288	So we can say <strong>a piece of information </strong>or<strong> two pieces of advice.
158640	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. The other uncountable noun in that clip was <strong>accommodation</strong>.
163755	<strong> Accommodation </strong>means 'places to live or spend the night', like rooms, flats and houses.
169500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So <strong>accommodation</strong> describes the groups of places that you can stay like flats, houses, students halls of residence.
177740	And group words are often uncountable, so there's no plural form.
182100	<strong>Fruit</strong>,<strong> food</strong> and <strong>weather</strong> are group words too.
186000	We don't usually say <strong>fruits</strong>, <strong>foods</strong> and <strong>weathers</strong>.
189960	<strong>Catherine</strong><strong><br></strong>That's right. Now, let's have another clip. Can you spot any more uncountable nouns?
195866	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>How much <strong>baggage</strong> can you take and what's the best way to take <strong>money </strong>abroad?
202197	Will the <strong>traffic</strong> be bad on the way to the airport?
205554	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we had <strong>baggage</strong>,<strong> money </strong>and<strong> traffic</strong>.
210466	In some languages these words are often plural.
214093	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...but not in English. In English, they are all group words.
218333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. So<strong> baggage </strong>means a group of bags.
221990	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's<strong> money </strong>for coins or notes.
224700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>traffic</strong> for cars, lorries, buses.
227468	<strong>STING</strong>
230601	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And we're talking about uncountable nouns.
233966	We've seen that some activity nouns are uncountable, and some group nouns are uncountable.
239877	Shall we now talk about more types of uncountable nouns, Catherine?
243666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Go on then. So we've got liquids and gases.
248440	<strong>Water</strong> and <strong>air </strong>are uncountable.
251400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, they are. Materials and substances like <strong>wood </strong>and <strong>salt</strong> are uncountable too.
257488	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Then there are words for feelings and ideas, so <strong>happiness</strong> and <strong>education</strong>.
263580	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And also subjects like <strong>history</strong> and <strong>biology</strong>.
267550	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. But be careful with subjects like <strong>physics</strong> or <strong>economics</strong>.
272252	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, they end with the letter <strong>-s,</strong> so they look plural, but in fact they're usually uncountable too.
279300	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we use them with a singular verb, just like other uncountable nouns. Physics <strong>is</strong> complicated.
286975	<strong>Neil</strong><br>...and Economics <strong>isn't</strong> easy.

296463	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's quiz time! Number one: Is the word <strong>furniture</strong> countable or uncountable?
305555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is - it's uncountable. It's a group word like <strong>baggage</strong>.
311000	It means things like tables and chairs.
313444	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Very good. And number two: is this sentence correct or wrong?
317700	Please can you give me some informations?
320700	<strong>Neil</strong><br>That is not correct.
323483	<strong>Information</strong> is uncountable so it's <strong>some information</strong> without an -<strong>s</strong>, not <strong>some informations</strong>.
329728	<strong>Catherine.<br></strong>Very good! And the last one: Which is correct: a) it was beautiful weather on Saturday.
336140	Or b) it was a beautiful weather on Saturday.
340366	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The answer's a) it was beautiful weather on Saturday.
346288	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's the end of the quiz. Well done to you if you got them all right.
350277	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But before we go, here's a tip.
352256	When you see a noun, think carefully about whether it belongs to one of these types: activity words, information words or group words.
363700	If it does, then it's probably uncountable.
366500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.
