12111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finn.
16944	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me Catherine. And today's show is all about adjective order.
23488	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Adjectives - yes, those useful words we use to describe things.
28777	We'll look at what adjective order is - and how to use it.
32888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There'll be a nice, easy quiz.
35777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we'll leave you with a small, but meaningful tip for learning vocabulary.
41099	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So: let's start off with Nikki and Joe who are talking in a furniture shop.
46998	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Here's a question to think about while you listen: what did Nikki's grandparents have?
53922	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>What did Nikki's grandparents have? Let's find out.
58777	<strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Nikki<br></strong>Joe! Come and sit on this sofa!
61888	<strong>Joe<br></strong>It's really uncomfortable.
63700	<strong>Nikki<br></strong>I know... but I've always wanted a big, old, leather sofa.
68666	My grandparents had one when I was little.
71444	<strong>Joe<br></strong>That's not a good reason to buy a horrible sofa!
74666	The one with the stripy blue cotton cushions looks a lot nicer.
78222	<strong>Nikki<br></strong>Maybe. Ooh what's this. Look, a beautiful green and blue Turkish kilim!
85574	<strong>Joe<br></strong>Kilim? Oh, a little carpet. Sofas first, Nikki.
92222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, that's Joe and Nikki. And we asked you: what did Nikki's grandparents have?
99086	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: they had <em>a big, old, leather sofa</em>.
104777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. And the phrase <em>a big, old, leather sofa</em> is our first example of <strong>adjective order</strong>.
112335	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, when we use two or more adjectives together to describe a noun, the order we put them in is important.
119800	For example, we don't usually say <em>an old, leather, big sofa.
126055	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So for our sofa example, first it's size - so <em>big</em>, then age - <em>old</em>, and then material - <em>leather</em>. A <em>big, old, leather sofa.
139888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that's size, age, and material type. And each new adjective in the list needs to go in the right place.
149666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>For example, colour goes between age and material type. So we can say: a <em>big, old, red, leather sofa</em>.
158888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now some people find it difficult to remember the adjective order.
163777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But there's a good tip which is: the adjective with the meaning most closely related to the noun goes nearest to it.
172777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And in our example, the material type - <em>leather</em> - is most closely connected to the noun.
179666	<em>Big, old</em> and <em>red</em> are more general. So: <em>big, old, red,&nbsp;<strong>leather</strong> sofa</em>. Another one please, Finn?
188555	<strong>Finn<br></strong><em>Blue stripy cotton cushions.
192333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So colour - <em>blue</em>, quality - <em>stripy</em>, and material type - <em>cotton</em>. <em>Blue stripy cotton cushions</em>.
201300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And Nikki got very excited about a <em>beautiful green and blue Turkish kilim</em>.
208444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Did she? I can understand that.
210333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes. So it's a beautiful green and blue Turkish kilim.
216111	There we had opinion: beautiful, and then colours: green and blue, we had two colours joined by 'and', and then country: Turkish.
227111	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
232999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're talking about adjective order.
236444	And you might have noticed that we used some adjectives at the beginning of the programme.
241777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We had <em>nice, easy quiz</em> - with two opinion adjectives.
246444	<em>Easy</em> has a closer connection to the noun <em>quiz</em> than <em>nice</em>.
251064	So we put <em>easy</em> next to the noun. A nice easy quiz.
255077	<strong>Finn<br></strong>A nice, easy quiz. And another one: <em>a</em> <em>small, but meaningful tip</em>.
259694	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We can put 'but' between adjectives when they seem a bit unusual next to each other. Like <em>small, but meaningful</em>.
267000	<strong>Finn<br></strong><em>Strange, but true</em>, eh, Catherine?
270000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Indeed. Nothing strange about vocabulary.
273666	So let's hear today's examples again. First, size, age, colour, and material.
280888	<strong>Finn<br></strong><em>Big, old, red, leather sofa</em>.
285686	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <em>leather</em> has the strongest connection to the noun. Next, colour, quality, and material.
293015	<strong>Finn<br></strong><em>Blue stripy cotton cushions</em>.
296844	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And opinion, colour, and country.
300497	<strong>Finn<br></strong><em>Beautiful green and blue Turkish kilim</em>.
304601	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. And now it's quiz time. Put these adjectives in the right order.
310888	Number 1. <em>I love my ... old, smelly, big dog.
317564	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right: <em>I love my big, old, smelly dog.
322722	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. Number 2. <em>This is a ... Moroccan, simple, but delicious recipe.
329666	<strong>Finn<br></strong><em>This is a simple, but delicious, Moroccan recipe.
334111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very good. And that brings us almost to the end of the programme.
337511	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But before we go, here's that tip we promised you, and it's a game this time.
342444	Now, this is a game to play with a friend to practise describing things.
347000	Think of a noun but don't tell your friend what it is.
351091	Then give adjective clues to help them guess the noun.
355177	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good game. Do you want to play?
356788	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Let's give it a go.
357500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Brilliant. There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.
