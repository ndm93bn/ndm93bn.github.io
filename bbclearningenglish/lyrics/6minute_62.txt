1	(Introduction...)
12333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello, I'm Rob, and welcome to 6 Minute English, where today we're chatting about a pedestrian topic and six items of related vocabulary.
21222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello, I'm Neil. A <strong>pedestrian</strong> is someone who walks around rather than travelling by car or bus.
27900	But in Rob's sentence he used the adjective, and in this context it means dull or uninteresting!
33722	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And of course I was making a pun, Neil. Because of course the show is going to be extremely interesting!
39600	It'sabout safety on the streets - and whether pedestrianisation is a good thing or not.
45555	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Pedestrianisation</strong> means changing a street into an area that can only be used by pedestrians.
51888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, it sounds like a good idea - no traffic, less noise and air pollution.
56833	And no chance of getting knocked down by a car or a bus!
60555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>There are plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street, which is one of the busiest shopping streets in London.
66333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's right. The Mayor of London wants to<strong> tackle </strong>- or make an effort to deal with - air pollution in this very busy spot - where the amount of traffic is definitely a problem!
76500	In fact, can you tell me, Neil, what's the average speed of a bus travelling along Oxford Street?
82774	Is it:<br>a) 4.6 miles per hour,<br>b) 14.6 miles per hour or<br>c) 46 miles per hour?
91923	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I think it's 14.6 miles per hour - a) sounds too slow and c) sounds too fast!
98812	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, we'll find out the answer later on. The problem is - the traffic doesn't just disappear.
104555	You ban it from one area - and it gets rerouted somewhere else.
108475	<strong>Neil<br>Ban</strong> means to say officially that something can't be done.
112066	And <strong>reroute</strong> means to change the direction you're travelling in, in order to reach a particular destination.
117666	That's true, Rob. It must be a big headache for city planners.
121600	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, let's listen now to Joe Urvin, Chief Executive of Living Streets.
126600	He's going to talk some more about why traffic is causing problems in our towns and cities.
133222	<strong>INSERT<br><strong>Joe Urvin, Chief Executive of Living Streets<br></strong></strong>In 1970 we had 20 million cars in this country.
137398	Now we have over 30 million cars in such a short period. So that creates three big problems.
143222	One is space - because we've still got the same street structures in our towns and cities, causing congestion.
148555	It causes pollution, which people are concerned about more and more.
151739	And actually, it's kind of engineering walking out of our lives. So we're actually not getting enough exercise, which is a cause of a health crisis.
159111	Smart cities are looking at pedestrianisation - in Glasgow, in Birmingham, in London for example, Manchester - as a way of not only making their places, cities better and more attractive, actually, building their local economy.
175222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So Neil Urvin identifies three problems - the first is that our city streets have stayed the same while the number of cars on the roads has increased dramatically.
186103	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's right - and this has led to congestion on our roads.
190000	<strong>Congestion</strong> means too much traffic, making it hard to move.
194003	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The second problem is pollution - which we mentioned earlier.
197555	<strong>Rob<br> Pollution</strong> is damage to the environment caused by releasing waste substances such as carbon dioxide into the air.
204555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the third problem is that by travelling around on buses or in our cars we aren't getting enough exercise.
210774	And we all know that's a bad thing! Would pedestrianisation engineer walking back into our lives do you think?
217479	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I'm not sure, Neil. It would be great if we could go shopping or walk to work without breathing in fumes or worrying about getting knocked down by a car.
225978	But banning all motorised traffic from town centres might make life difficult for people to get around.
232111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I'm not a town planner - and I don't have the answers.
235453	But I would like to know if I got the answer right to the question you asked me earlier!
239777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well I asked you: What's the average speed of a bus travelling along Oxford Street?
245667	Is it. a) 4.6mph, b) 14.6mph or c) 46mph?
253777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said 14.6mph.
256777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And that's not slow enough, Neil, I'm afraid. The answer is actually 4.6mph.
262684	And we pedestrians walk at an average speed of 3.1mph apparently!
267666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Good to know. OK - shall we go over the words we learned today, Rob?
272168	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Sure - the first one is 'pedestrian' - a person who is walking, usually in an area where there's traffic.
278771	'Sorry - you can't ride your bike here. This path is for pedestrians only.'
283666	<strong>Neil</strong><br>The adjective - 'This book is full of very pedestrian ideas. I wouldn't read it if I were you.'
289333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I've crossed it off my list, Neil. Thank you. OK - number two is 'to tackle' something, which means to make an effort to deal with a difficult problem.
297049	For example, 'The government isn't really tackling the problem of air pollution.It needs to do much more.'
303555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Very true. OK, 'ban' means to officially say that something can't be done.
308555	'The UK government will ban the sale of diesel and petrol cars from 2040.'
314000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And number four is 'reroute' which means to change the direction you're travelling in.
318827	<strong>Neil</strong><br>'The council has rerouted all buses to avoid the town centre.'
323222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>'Congestion' is number five - too much traffic, making it difficult to move.
327777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>'Road congestion always gets better in the summer when a lot of car drivers are on holiday.'
333222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's true, isn't it? London always seems emptier in July and August.
337111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Except for all the tourists walking around - congesting the streets!
340333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Very funny! And finally, number six is 'pollution' - which is damage to the environment caused by releasing waste substances such as carbon dioxide into the air, or plastic into the sea.
351566	<strong>Neil</strong><br>'You can help reduce air pollution by walking to work every day instead of driving.'
356555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Are you talking to me, Neil? I always walk to work!
359777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I know you do, Rob - you're an example to us all!
362555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, that's all we have time for today.
364999	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But please don't forget to visit us via our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages! Goodbye!
370017	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Bye bye!
