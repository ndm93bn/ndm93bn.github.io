1	(Introduction...)
15777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, I want you to close your eyes. Focus...on your breathing.
28111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Er, Neil? Can we do this later? We've only got six minutes.
33208	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ok, Catherine. Welcome to a <strong>mindful</strong> edition of 6 Minute English, where we're exploring the rise of <strong>mindfulness</strong> - particularly in schools.
42100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we'll be teaching six items of vocabulary along the way. So I think we should start with <strong>mindfulness</strong> itself.
49644	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Being <strong>mindful</strong>, as an adjective, means 'being calmly aware of everything in your body and mind'. You only focus on 'now'.
58111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>People practise <strong>mindfulness</strong>, the noun, by focusing only on their breath, and not allowing themselves to be distracted by passing thoughts.
67600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Indeed. It's traditionally associated with Buddhism, and has become incredibly popular in the <strong>secular</strong> world - in workplaces, in private classes and even in schools.
77333	<strong>Catherine<br> Secular </strong>means 'non-religious' by the way.
79890	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, I just mentioned schools: how many teachers in the UK are trained to teach <strong>mindfulness</strong>? Is it.<br>a) 500,<br>b) 5,000 or<br>c) 50,000?
91444	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Let me focus really hard - I think it's 5,000.
97555	<strong>Neil<br> </strong>A very <strong>mindful</strong> answer, Catherine. But I'll reveal the real answer later.
102777	Now let's hear from one teacher who's been practising <strong>mindfulness </strong>with students for many years.
107722	Alison Mayo, Head of Early Years at Dharma Primary School, thinks it's particularly suited to young children. Why?
115858	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Alison Mayo, Head of Early Years, Dharma Primary School<br></strong>That's very natural for children - to be <strong>in the present</strong>.
119812	And we really kind of celebrate that because that is a place where they are learning.
123800	So, if they feel <strong>grounded</strong>, then they can really develop their concentration and their focus, and relax.
131100	Learning happens so much more easily if you're relaxed and happy.
136686	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Alison said it was natural for children to be <strong>in the present</strong>.
140700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>The present</strong> - means 'now'. You'll know it from the 'present tense' in grammar.
145555	And people who practise <strong>mindfulness</strong> use this phrase a lot - to be <strong>in the present</strong>, or <strong>in the present moment</strong>.
154555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It sounds simple, but actually it's very hard to achieve.
157777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, Neil, it might be for an old chap like you, but for young people, Miss Mayo thinks it's very natural.
164547	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Fair enough. Being <strong>grounded</strong>, as she says, helps students concentrate and learn in a relaxed way.
170500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Grounded</strong> is another good adjective there - it means 'rational, sensible, clear thinking'.
176777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, she's a fan of <strong>mindfulness</strong>. And there's growing evidence behind its benefits.
181555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. The UK's national health advisory body has recommended it to help treat conditions like depression and anxiety.
189666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Studies have shown it reduces levels of the stress hormone, cortisol.
193666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And a new study has claimed that eating <strong>mindfully</strong> can actually help people to lose weight.
199666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You mean eating slowly?
201100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, slowly and really experiencing and tasting the food.
205777	Not being distracted and not eating too much too fast!
209666	Anyway, Neil, is <strong>mindfulness</strong> taking over the world?
213944	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, not quite yet. There still aren't many detailed studies on it - and some critics say the studies we have show a publication <strong>bias</strong>.
221700	In other words, only the positive results are published.
224777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>A <strong>bias</strong> is when you support something or someone in an unfair way, because of your preferences or beliefs.
232100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>What seems certain is that <strong>mindfulness</strong> has entered into many aspects of modern life, at least here in the UK.
237840	Now, let's look back at our question. I asked how many teachers in the UK have been trained in <strong>mindfulness</strong>.
243999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I said 5,000.
245888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, it was actually 5,000. Well done! According to the <strong>Mindfulness</strong> Initiative. And it keeps on growing.
252647	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So before we finish up, here's another question that might be useful for our listeners - what's the difference between <strong>mindfulness</strong> and <strong>meditation</strong>?
261555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Aha - that's not so easy to define. <strong>Meditation</strong> is the broader term.
266000	When you <strong>meditate</strong> you spend time quietly - focusing your mind - often for relaxation or spiritual purposes.
272833	<strong>Mindfulness</strong> is a particular a kind of <strong>meditation</strong> - when you try to empty your mind of thought. Does that make sense?
279500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, more or less. So we'll let our listeners <strong>meditate</strong> on that answer.
284333	And before we empty our minds, let's look back at today's words.
288577	We had <strong>mindfulness</strong>, <strong>mindful</strong> and <strong>mindfully</strong> - they all relate to the particular practice of being only focused of what's happening now.
299000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>What's happening now, or we could say - what's happening <strong>in the present</strong>.
302555	People often focus on the past - thinking back about mistakes or happy memories.
307100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or on the future - which can be full of worries. But by being <strong>in the present</strong> - you overcome these thoughts and fears.
314347	Next we had <strong>secular</strong>. It contrasts with 'religious'. So, while a church is a religious building, we also have <strong>secular</strong> buildings - like factories and shops and hospitals.
326111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>All non-religious buildings, in other words!
328111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now, tell me Neil, are you feeling <strong>grounded</strong> right now?
332222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You're asking if I'm thinking clearly and feeling connected to the world?
336111	Do you even have to ask, Catherine - I'm a very <strong>grounded</strong> person.
339388	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You are, most of the time. Most of the time you're naturally <strong>grounded</strong>, every now and again you get a bit panicked, but .
345888	some of us need to remember to slow down, chill out and <strong>meditate</strong> once in a while.
351777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, that would be <strong>meditate</strong> meaning to take quiet time to focus deeply on something.
357077	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now for more ways to improve your English I suggest you <strong>mindfully</strong> visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.
365444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, focus only on our pages. Don't be distracted by anything else!
369666	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye!
