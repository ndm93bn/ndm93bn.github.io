12724	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
15280	I'm Neil.
15771	<strong>Alice<br></strong> And I'm Alice.
17424	My chair feels [audibly shifts about in her chair] uncomfortable today.
20859	How does yours feel?
23003	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Um. mine is fine - very comfortable, thank you.
25211	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, it would be nice if you offered to give me your chair, Neil.
29275	<strong>Neil<br></strong>What? No chance.
31024	Well, I would be uncomfortable then, wouldn't I?
34192	<strong>Alice<br></strong>You should give me your seat, Neil.
36327	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Should I?
37105	Well, now might be a good time to mention that chivalry is the subject of today's show.
43239	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Chivalry</strong> these days means polite behaviour usually by men towards women.
48220	<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>Though in the past it referred to a code of behaviour followed by knights in the Middle Ages.
54129	It was all about honour and courage in battle - and only later on about being polite to the ladies.
60423	Well, we aren't living in the Middle Ages any more, are we?
63708	<strong>Alice<br> </strong>No comment.
64732	Let's go for our traditional question.
67068	I have a literary one for you today: Who wrote the novel <em>Don Quixote</em>, about a 50-year old man travelling Spain in search of knightly adventures in rusty armour and a cardboard helmet?
77681	Was it.
78812	<br>a) Miguel de Cervantes<br>b) Leo Tolstoy<br>Or c) William Shakespeare?
85511	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I think - I'm going to get it right today, Alice - I'm going to say a) Miguel de Cervantes.
91367	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show if you were right or not.
96017	But first, do you think chivalry is dead, Neil?
99164	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, not at all - these traditions are alive and kicking - in Poland at any rate.
104327	If something is <strong>alive and kicking</strong> it means it's active.
107483	The BBC reporter Adam Easton saw it with his own eyes and is going to describe it for us.
112997	<strong>INSERT<br> Adam Easton, BBC reporter<br></strong>Medieval knights' tournaments or battle re-enactments are popular across Europe.
119792	But there's something about dressing up as a knight that particularly appeals to people here in Poland.
124656	In the summer there's events every weekend and here in Malbork Northern Poland home to Europe's largest medieval castle there's one of the biggest of the season.
134789	There's archery, crossbow, jousting, other horse skills, and more than a hundred thousand people come to watch these tournaments.
141317	<strong>Alice<br></strong>The BBC reporter Adam Easton.
144368	By the way, what's a <strong>re-enactment</strong>, Neil?
147003	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's where you perform the actions of a past event.
150267	And in Malbork in Poland they stage battle re-enactments every weekend apparently - at least in the summer months!
157296	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Mmm.
158043	it doesn't sound like <strong>my cup of tea</strong> - and that means it doesn't sound like something I would enjoy doing - how about you, Neil?
165136	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I'm not sure about the archery, crossbow and jousting.
168692	It all sounds like too much hard work.
171188	But I'd definitely enjoy the dressing up.
173951	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Excellent!
175327	Well,<strong> jousting</strong> is where two people fight on horseback using a <strong>lance</strong> - or long pole - to try to knock the other person off their horse, especially as part of a <strong>tournament</strong> - or sporting event.
187327	So with the dressing up, Neil - I'm curious.
191306	I can't imagine you as a knight in shining armour, to be honest.
194655	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Come on, Alice.
195551	I'd look very appealing to any damsel in distress.
198676	A <strong>damsel in distress</strong> is a young unmarried woman in need of help.
202740	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK.
203722	You might make a very <strong>fetching</strong> - or attractive - knight, Neil.
207359	But you should get used to actually helping the ladies .
210868	maybe offering me your seat.
212938	I'm still sitting uncomfortably here.
215391	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Come on, Alice, a knight needs to sit comfortably too.
219060	We've always been the ones with battles to fight!
221780	<strong>Alice<br></strong>But at some point in the history of chivalry - <strong>prowess</strong> - or skill - on the battlefield became combined with a set of <strong>conventions</strong> - or rules - governing other aspects of behaviour.
233375	This included a knight's moral and religious duties and how to conduct their love affairs.
238868	Professor Laura Ashe at Oxford University explains.
242335	<strong>INSERT<br> Laura Ashe, Associate Professor in English at the University of Oxford, UK<br></strong>The really strange thing is the idea that love should somehow make you a better knight.
248458	I mean, this is what is suddenly claimed in the late 12th century and it makes very little sense, you know, if you imagine a footballer telling his teammates that being in love makes him a better footballer.
258378	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That was Professor Laura Ashe.
260826	And I agree with her.
261839	What has being a great footballer or a great warrior got to do with love?
266159	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, <strong>courtly love </strong>was a social code governing behaviour between aristocratic men and women that developed at the same time and amongst the same people as chivalry and the two became <strong>intertwined</strong> - or hard to separate - from then on.
279972	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>aristocrats</strong> are people of high social rank.
283204	OK Alice, I think it's time you told us the answer to today's quiz question.
287748	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Good idea.
288602	OK.
289231	I asked: Who wrote the novel <em>Don Quixote</em>, about a 50-year old man travelling Spain in search of knightly adventures in rusty armour and a cardboard helmet?
299044	Was it.
299844	a) Miguel de Cervantes, b) LeonTolstoy or c) William Shakespeare?
306170	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said a) Miguel de Cervantes.
308783	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And you were right!
311247	Well done!
312996	<em>Don Quixote</em> was written by Miguel de Cervantes and published in 1605.
318031	It's a comic novel which describes what happens to an elderly knight who, his head muddled by reading too many romances, sets out on his old horse with his companion Sancho Panza, to seek adventure.
329972	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Very interesting, Alice.
331241	Now can we hear the words we learned today?
334121	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Sure, they are:<br>chivalry<br>alive and kicking<br>re-enactment<br>my cup of tea<br>jousting<br>lance<br>tournament<br>fetching<br>damsel in distress<br>prowess<br>conventions<br>courtly love<br>intertwined<br>aristocrats
357683	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
360222	Please join us again soon.
361848	And. By the way, Alice, would you like my chair?
364621	It's very comfortable.
365464	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh, thank you - now that the programme is over, Neil!
368290	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Better late than never.
369506	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye.
