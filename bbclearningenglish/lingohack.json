Reunion Island, a tropical paradise in the Indian Ocean. But over the past few years this island has become notorious as the shark attack capital of the world. After the first attacks, the local authorities put a blanket ban on surfing and swimming on the island, and that hit the island's idyllic tourism image hard. Since 2015, the figures do show a slow increase in the number of tourists to the island. That was the year that the government installed a series of exclusion nets on two beaches on the island's western coast."

Led by British explorer Pen Hadow, they have a 3,500 mile voyage ahead. It's the rapidly warming conditions in the Artctic that have made this expedition even possible.

This year the global market for baby care products is expected to reach 66.8 billion dollars. Take every parent's desire to get the best for their kids... fuel it with the classic consumer desire to keep up with the Joneses, and big profits for the baby gear companies seem to be child's play."

   "desc": "Knife crime has increased by nine percent across England and Wales. In London it's risen by sixteen per cent over the last two years. Several years ago it was predominantly a gang problem. Now the police think seventy-five per cent of those who carry have no associations with gangs - they're just doing it because everyone else is. Highly recognisable - but while Chester Zoo's giraffes are loved by the visitors, in their natural African habitat, the animals are suffering what has been called a devastating decline. Illegal hunting, expanding agriculture and civil unrest have all been cited as factors pushing the long-necked mammals towards extinction. Twenty-five-year-old Conchi Rios is one of only four female matadors in the world of Spanish bullfighting. She said it took a few years to get a job as a bullfighter in Spain, but that it was worth fighting to do the job she loves. Bullfighting is controversial in Spain, but Conchi says those who are against it don't necessarily understand it."

   "desc": "This is Copenhagen's seedy red light district - a well-known area to buy drugs. It's home to one of the city's so-called 'fix rooms'... a place where addicts can legally take class A drugs safely under supervision and without the fear of prosecution. This place opened three years ago funded by the city with public money. There's always a nurse here to supervise the users. But the fix room is clearly not a treatment facility to get addicts off drugs and many people will come in and out of the fix room and go back to their difficult and sometimes dangerous lifestyles. A study of 2 million Canadians found around 10% of dementia cases in urban areas could be linked to exposure to heavy traffic. The researchers found that living within 50 metres of a major road increased the risk of dementia by 7 to 11%. At 100 metres the increased risk was 4%. This research doesn't prove that heavy traffic causes dementia. It makes a fascinating link that requires further investigation. For now, the best advice to reduce your dementia risk is to exercise and eat healthily. Red panda cubs Harriet and Hazel see the snow for the first time at their Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden home. They keep nice and warm thanks to their bushy tails and have plenty of energy to frolic around. Awwww...."

The official advice from counter-terrorism police is to run - hide if you can't run - and then tell the emergency services. The CitizenAID system goes a step further. It suggests people, once safe, should try to help others. The app explains how to prioritise those who are ill and how to stop severe bleeding. A large spread of ingredients destined for the trash. This was all rescued by volunteers in London. Because of food handling laws, there's no meat. Nevertheless, it's transformed into free healthy meals and served to many living in social isolation and poverty.  FoodCycle is a charity with close to thirty hubs across the UK.  The UN estimates that roughly a third of all food produced for humans goes uneaten. This New Zealand street is officially the world's steepest residential road. Baldwin Street in the city of Dunedin has an inclination of 35 degrees and has been attracting many visitors. It's irresistible for daredevils on bikes. It's also the stage for an annual charity event in which 30,000 chocolate balls are rolled down the road. "
