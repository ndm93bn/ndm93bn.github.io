11692	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14369	I'm Alice.
15191	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>And I'm Rob.
16353	Alice, I read in the paper recently that the substance called 'fluoride' might be bad for our health.
23415	But it's in nearly every brand of toothpaste, isn't it?
26273	<strong>Alice<br></strong>You shouldn't believe everything you hear, Rob.
28908	Fluoride protects our teeth against decay.
31937	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But there's a theory that drug companies are using fluoride to affect our brains.
37793	and make us all dumb.
39383	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's ridiculous Rob!
41196	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well.
41804	I'm not sure if I believe it or not.
44399	But it is worrying me.
45305	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Do you also worry that the moon landings never really happened?
49487	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's funny you should mention that because.
51987	Yes! I wonder about this too.
54109	Apparently, in the 1960s television footage of the moon landing, the American flag is fluttering - and there's no air on the moon so the US government must've faked it!
64808	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>To fake</strong> <strong>something</strong> means to make something that isn't true appear to be real.
69875	I didn't realize you were so <strong>gullible</strong> Rob - and that means easily persuaded to believe something.
76776	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I just like to question things.
78941	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh, I see.
79571	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I have a healthy distrust of authority, Alice.
82467	And today we're talking about conspiracy theories - a <strong>conspiracy theory</strong> is a belief that some organization or group of people is responsible for a situation or event through secret planning.
94894	<strong>Alice<br></strong>We'll talk more about how healthy this type of distrust might be later on in the show.
100398	But now please focus your intellectual powers on today's quiz question, Rob.
105699	Around what proportion of the US population believes that the assassination of President John F Kennedy was not the result of a lone gunman?
116110	Is it.
116579	a) 6%?
118371	<br>b) 16%?
120355	<br>Or c) 60%?
122595	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I'll go for b) 16%.
125080	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme.
129592	But for now let's move on.
131480	Let's talk about what types of people are thought to be <strong>susceptible to</strong> - or likely to be influenced by - conspiracy theories.
139213	<strong>Rob<br></strong>The stereotype is of a loner, maybe male, middle aged, sitting in front of the computer.
144696	But in actual fact this isn't true.
146936	People of all ages and from all social classes are susceptible to conspiracy theories.
153059	Lots of us worry that important things are being covered up - and a <strong>cover-up</strong> means an attempt to prevent the public from discovering information about something important.
163022	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Let's listen now to Professor Chris French from Goldsmiths, a college within the University of London, talking more about people who believe in conspiracy theories.
173325	<strong>INSERT<br> Chris French, Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London<br></strong>There are quite a few personality dimensions that seem to be related to belief in conspiracy theories and not surprisingly paranoia is one of them; also openness to new ideas - people who are willing to entertain ideas that are kind of off the beaten track.
188173	People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to believe in the paranormal.
191373	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That was Professor Chris French.
194307	So he says that paranoia is a personality <strong>trait</strong> - or quality - that leads some people to believe in conspiracy theories.
202765	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Paranoia</strong> is a strong and unreasonable feeling that other people don't like you or want to harm you.
210435	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And ideas that are <strong>off the beaten track</strong> are those which are unusual and aren't shared by many other people.
217421	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Believing in the <strong>paranormal</strong> means believing in strange things that can't be explained by science, for example, ghosts.
225496	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Ghosts, yes.
226674	Do you believe in them, Alice?
227783	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No, Rob, I don't.
229351	How about you?
230055	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, maybe.
231175	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Moving on.
232253	Most of the time believing in conspiracy theories is quite harmless and might even be good - because we shouldn't just accept everything that we're told.
240967	But there can also be serious consequences.
244189	Let's hear more from Professor French on this.
246429	<strong>INSERT<br> Chris French, Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London<br></strong>Studies have shown that people are less likely to engage with the political process.
252061	People who accept medically based conspiracies are likely to avoid getting their kids vaccinated.
259975	And even terrorist acts - it's been shown that terrorist groups will actually use conspiracy theories as both a means to get new recruits and also to motivate people to carry out extreme terrorist acts.
274183	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So the toothpaste thing I mentioned at the beginning of the show is a medically based conspiracy theory?
281853	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
282717	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But more serious examples are parents choosing not to vaccinate their children against diseases because of <strong>unsubstantiated</strong> ideas that they are harmful - 'unsubstantiated' means 'not supported by evidence'.
296850	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's right.
297831	OK, now remember the question I asked earlier, Rob?
301575	Around what proportion of the US population believes that the assassination of President John F Kennedy wasn't the result of a lone gunman?
310802	Is it.
311549	a) 6%, b) 16% or c) 60%?
317447	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, I said b) 16%.
319901	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And you were wrong today, Rob, I'm afraid.
323229	The answer is actually c) 60%.
326855	And this statistic comes from a Gallup poll from 2013 that suggests a clear majority of Americans still believe others, besides the gunman Lee Harvey Oswald, were involved.
338290	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's more than I expected.
340178	But they might have a point.
343175	<strong>Alice<br></strong>There you go again.
344903	Come on, Rob.
346749	Now let me remind everybody what words we've heard today.
349789	They are:
350642	to fake something<br>gullible<br>conspiracy theory<br>susceptible<br>cover-up<br>trait<br>paranoia<br>off the beaten track<br>paranormal<br>unsubstantiated
