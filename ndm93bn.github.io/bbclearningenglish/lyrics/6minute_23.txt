1	( Introduction... )
11956	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14713	I'm Alice.
15339	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>... And I'm Rob.
16129	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So Rob, did you have a part time job while you were at university?
20044	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, I worked in the student bar.
22637	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Did you learn anything from the experience?
24747	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I learned how to pull a decent pint.
26985	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Did you learn anything else?
28800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, I learned how to add up.
31241	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Didn't they teach you that at school?
33053	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I wasn't good at doing sums in my head - you know - mental arithmetic.
37118	But I got pretty good at it as a barman.
39737	They didn't have computerized cash registers in my day, you see.
43463	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I didn't realize you were <em>that</em> old, Rob!
46252	Anyway, the subject of today's show is young business entrepreneurs.
51349	So, can you answer this question: How young were the founders of Facebook and Microsoft when they first set up their companies?
59027	Were they.
59889	<br>a) junior high-school students<br>b) high-school students<br>Or c) university students?
68173	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And Alice in case you think I don't know, Facebook is an online social networking service and Microsoft is a computer software company.
76138	OK?
76711	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well done!
78085	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well I'm going to say they were b) high-school students.
82284	<strong>Alice<br></strong>We'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme.
86392	But let's talk now about what <strong>drawbacks</strong> - or disadvantages - there are for young entrepreneurs.
92626	What do you think, Rob?
93712	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hmm. Well, I suppose one of the drawbacks of being young and your own boss is that everyone who works for you is older than you!
101342	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Is that a drawback?
102576	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, let's consider a real case.
105476	Young British entrepreneur Suleman Sacranie started his first company when he was 17, followed by another business shortly afterwards.
114051	Then whilst studying chemistry at university he started his third company, an online version of the pound shop - or dollar store in the US - where everything in the shop is priced at one pound.
126726	Let's listen to Suleman Sacranie talking about his company.
130589	<strong>INSERT<br> Suleman Sacranie, founder of online wholesaler 99pwholesaler.com<br></strong> I'm actually quite fortunate now, compared to what I was six months ago because now I've got two additional directors who have grey hair. It actually... commercial meetings are excellent now, you know.
140727	But before that I think I came across quite professional but you could still tell they were thinking in the back of their heads, 'I've got a kid sitting in front of me.'
149363	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So young entrepreneur Suleman Sacranie has got two grey-haired directors working with him now.
156732	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's right - but how does having grey-haired executives on board help, Rob?
161502	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, '<strong>executives</strong>' are people who run a business and <strong>on board</strong> means being part of a team.
167313	Well, to answer your question, Alice, they bring experience to the table.
171464	I have a few grey hairs you know - you could learn a lot from me.
174905	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I do, Rob.
176207	Everyday.
176827	And if you<strong> bring something to the table </strong>it means you provide something useful.
181877	Well, what do you bring to the table, Rob?
184331	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, bad jokes, peanuts, crisps, cups of coffee, that sort of thing.
189591	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I was going to say a <strong>keen</strong> mind, in other words, a well-developed mind, and.
195109	great business acumen!
196842	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Come on, you weren't going to say that!
198650	<strong>Alice<br></strong>You're right, I wasn't.
199935	<strong>Acumen</strong> means good judgement.
202677	But don't worry, you have an abundant enthusiasm that makes up for it.
206417	But moving on now, do you think that school prepared you well for working life?
211776	<strong>Rob<br></strong>No, not really.
213649	I studied Latin at school, and I don't use that much.
215497	And maths - well, I never use trigonometry or calculus.
219355	So I'm not sure how useful maths lessons were.
222260	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, and you only learned to add up in the university bar after all.
226292	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, but I am very good at it!
227813	And the point is that I've got a fantastic job now.
231339	And if you're really interested in something you can always <strong>acquire</strong> - or get - the skills you don't have.
237477	Let's listen to successful young entrepreneur Jessica Rose talking about her experience.
242918	She works with jewellery.
245025	<strong>INSERT<br> Jessica Rose, owner of a jewellery making business<br></strong>I didn't need all these previous skills and experience to go out there and start on my own.
250531	When I first started I had no business training whatsoever, no jewellery training whatsoever, but I kind of woke up one day and thought I'd really love to be a jewellery designer.
260581	Which is kind of a tricky position to be in, because it's you know, a lot of people would say and did say, well, you know, you're mad.
268316	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So Jessica Rose used her savings to learn jewellery making and then set up her own jewellery-making business.
276583	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And despite setting out with no business experience and no jewellery training - her enthusiasm for the article <strong>paid off</strong>.
284293	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And that means it was successful.
286680	<strong>Rob<br></strong>A bit like me.
287789	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
288745	OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.
292266	I asked: How young were the founders of Facebook and Microsoft when first set up their companies?
298529	Were they.
299721	a) junior high-school students, b) high-school students or c) university students?
308119	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I said b) high-school students.
311156	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid, Rob. Sorry.
314565	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Again.
315013	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
315581	Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates were both university students when they started their companies.
321367	Zuckerberg was studying at Harvard in the US when he launched Facebook in 2004.
326441	And Bill Gates took a break from Harvard to launch Microsoft in 1976, but never returned to his studies.
334272	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Both at Harvard - that's a coincidence.
336716	I wonder if the bar there was any good.
339797	Now can we hear the words we learned today?
342707	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. OK.
343654	They are:<br>drawbacks<br>executives<br>on board<br>bring something to the table<br>keen<br>(business) acumen<br>acquire<br>paid off
358657	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thanks, Alice. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
363745	We hope you've enjoyed the new vocabulary we brought to the table.
367328	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Very good.
368159	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Please join us again soon!
369374	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye.
