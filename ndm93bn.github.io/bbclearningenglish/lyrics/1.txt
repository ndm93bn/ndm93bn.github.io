2333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14569	I'm Neilâ€¦
15305	<strong>Alice<br></strong>â€¦ and I'm Alice.
16204	Now Neil, I'm a big fan of chat shows, as you know.
19856	But what do you think makes a good interview?
23000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I like it when the interviewer asks a question that <strong>catches</strong> the guest <strong>off guard</strong>.
28107	You know - to surprise them so they're embarrassed and don't know what to say.
31905	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's not very nice!
33346	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I know.
34040	But it's great TV.
35103	That's what chat shows are all about, isn't it?
37676	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, I don't agree, Neil!
39681	A <strong>chat show</strong>, by the way, is a TV or radio programme where a <strong>host</strong> - the person who presents the show - talks to guest celebrities about various topics.
49594	And what makes a good interview is the subject of today's show.
53314	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So what's a good interview technique, Alice?
56385	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, asking <strong>open questions</strong> - questions the celebrities can't easily respond to with a short answer.
63338	Open questions give them the chance to talk and possibly reveal some juicy details about themselves!
69569	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Juicy details </strong>means information you find interesting because it's exciting or shocking.
74937	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
75592	So let's test your interviewing skills, Neil.
78329	Ask me something - see if you can get some juicy details.
81642	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OKâ€¦ Hmmâ€¦ How much do you weigh?
85116	<strong>Alice<br></strong>How much do I weigh?
87241	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah.
88304	<strong>Alice<br></strong>How much do <em>you</em> weigh?
89572	Look, that's a <strong>closed question</strong> - you're going to get a short answer and no juicy details!
96764	And more importantly, Neil, it's a rude question!
99874	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK - bad choice.
100975	Sorry.
101631	But your reaction was juicy - you got pretty <strong>hot under the collar</strong> - and that means embarrassed or angry!
107932	I'll try to think of a better question to ask you before the end of the show.
111692	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Alright then.
112388	Now, since you aren't good at <em>asking</em> questions, perhaps you can <em>answer</em> one instead.
118201	Who developed a method of questioning around two and a half thousand years ago that aims to discover hidden truths?
125857	Was itâ€¦<br>a) Hippocrates?
128965	<br>b) Socrates?
131187	<br>Or c) Aristotle?
133682	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I don't know much about ancient history so I'm going to guess c) Aristotle.
139342	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out if you picked the right answer later on - but now let's listen to Larry King talking about the secret of his successful career as a TV chat show host.
150035	Can you spot a word that means to get or produce?
153881	<strong>INSERT<br>Larry King, TV chat show host, US<br></strong>If you ask good questions and you elicit thoughtful answers then you learn more about the person.
161366	If the interview's hard - if I begin by saying, 'Why did you do that?
166775	' I'd make you defensive.
168217	That may be thrilling television, but you don't learn a lot.
172859	I learned that the more I drew back, asked good questions, listened to the answers, cared about the guest â€¦ you make the camera disappear.
185736	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The word Larry King used isâ€¦ <strong>elicit</strong>.
190354	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Right.
191052	And <em>you</em> elicited a defensive reaction from me when you asked a not very thoughtful question about my weight.
197754	<strong>Defensive</strong> means protecting yourself from criticism or attack.
202090	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, I wouldn't make a good chat show host then.
205239	<strong>Alice<br></strong>You're right there.
206505	So good interviewers <strong>draw back</strong> - or move away - from being the centre of attention.
212398	They're good listeners and care about their guests.
215676	Sound familiar?
217311	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Are you suggesting that you're a good interviewer?
219564	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yup.
220342	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, well, so why aren't you a top chat show host, hmm?
224880	What does Larry mean when he says you have to<strong> make the camera disappear</strong>?
229586	<strong>Alice<br></strong>It means to make the conversation real - as if you were chatting with a friend - rather than performing to a TV audience.
236621	But let's hear more from Larry King on the secret of his success.
240288	<strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Larry King, TV chat show host, US<br></strong>I don't want a 'no'.
242900	I don't want a 'yes'.
244043	I want a 'why'.
245024	So in other words, I want to be a little kind of dumb.
250095	My friend Herbie said the secret of my success is being dumb.
255075	'What do you mean by that?'
257974	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So you have to ask <strong>dumb</strong> - or stupid - questions to make a great chat show host!
264388	I knew it!
265166	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Maybe there's hope for you yet, Neil.
266723	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Charming.
267665	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Lovely.
268440	OK, here's the answer to today's quiz question.
270935	I asked: Who developed a method of questioning around two and a half thousand years ago that aims to discover hidden truths?
278867	Was itâ€¦ a) Hippocrates?
281362	b) Socrates?
282886	Or c) Aristotle?
285091	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said c) Aristotle.
286891	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No, it was b) Socrates.
289837	All three were famous Greek philosophers but Socrates was the one who angered lots of important people by his <strong>probing</strong> - or investigative - questions - and this technique is called Socratic Dialogue.
302874	Socrates lived from 469 to 399 BC and he influenced philosophy so much that all previous thinkers have come to be known as Pre-Socratic.
313958	Despite this he declared "All I know is that I know nothing".
318088	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Very noble.
318783	OK, a final question for you, Alice.
321155	What makes you happy?
322750	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Working with such a fantastic co-presenter, Neil.
325746	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's nice!
327213	I'm embarrassed now.
328481	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Can you tell us the words we heard today?
331015	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Of course!

363413	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
