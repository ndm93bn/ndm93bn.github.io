1	(Introduction...)
12138	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello, and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
15646	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And me, Finn. In this programme, we're bringing you four different phrases that we use to talk about the future.
31368	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, we're looking at <strong>will</strong>, <strong>going to, might</strong> and <strong>be likely to</strong>.
37769	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We'll tell you when we use each oneâ€¦
40045	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We'll look at their formsâ€¦
41500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And there'll be a quiz to test what you've learned. Let's get started.
48734	Catherine, can you give us an example sentence with <strong>will</strong>:
53766	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I can Finn. My example sentence is: I will be 29 years old next Tuesday.
60820	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's amazing. I thought it was Wednesday.
65438	It's my birthday next Tuesday, too. <strong>I'm going to be 28.
70002	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Really?!
70682	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No, it was just an example with <strong>going to!
75336	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And mine was just an example with <strong>will</strong>.
77783	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, for something we know that will happen for certain, we can use <strong>will</strong> or <strong>going to</strong> with an infinitive verb without to.
87474	We can often use either <strong>will</strong> or <strong>going to</strong> with no change in meaning.
93596	So I said: <strong>I'm going to be 28.
96848	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and I said: <strong>I will be 29 next Tuesday</strong>.
100402	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Butâ€¦ if we are sure that something is going to happen in the future, because of something that is happening in the present, it's best to use <strong>going to</strong>.
109697	And here's Neil with an example:
112705	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Look at that clear blue sky! It's <strong>going to</strong> be a lovely day.
119605	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, so we don't usually look out of the window and say: Look at that clear blue sky!
127124	It will be a lovely day.
129166	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Not usually. It's usually <strong>going to</strong> when something happens now that makes us know what will happen later.
138136	So that's <strong>will</strong> and <strong>going to.</strong>
140409	Now, sometimes we are not so certain that something is going to happenâ€¦
144956	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and that's when we use <strong>might</strong> or <strong>might not</strong> plus an <strong>infinitive without</strong> <strong>to</strong>. Examples please, Neil?
152850	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I <strong>might move </strong>to New York next year. It depends on work.
158499	We <strong>might not come </strong>to the party. Our daughter isn't well at the moment.
165144	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We can also express future uncertainly with <strong>be</strong> <strong>likely to </strong>plus an<strong> infinitive.
173929	Be likely to </strong>is a bit more certain than<strong> might. Neil.
178662	<strong>Neil<br></strong>There's a lot of traffic. The journey <strong>is likely to take</strong> more than three hours.
185377	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you. And for negatives we use, <strong>be not likely to, </strong>or, more often,<strong> be unlikely to, </strong>again, with<strong> an infinitive.</strong>
196254	For example: <br><strong>Neil<br></strong>He hasn't trained very hard.
200660	<strong>He's not likely to win</strong> the race. It's a long way.
206206	The journey <strong>is unlikely to take</strong> less than three hours.
210139	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar, from BBC Learning English.
217053	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're talking about <strong>will</strong>, <strong>going to, might</strong> and <strong>be likely to</strong>.
222944	Let's look at questions.
224863	For <strong>will, going to</strong> and <strong>likely to</strong>, the word order is: <strong>will</strong>, <strong>going to</strong>, or <strong>be</strong> <strong>likely to</strong>, plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>verb</strong>.
235613	Here are some examples.
237605	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Will </strong>they <strong>win </strong>the election? Yes, they <strong>will</strong>.
243357	<strong>Is he going to resign?</strong> No, he <strong>won't</strong>.
249854	<strong>Is she likely to pass?</strong>Yes, she <strong>is</strong>.
256802	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We can also start with a question word:
260970	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>When</strong> <strong>will </strong>my order <strong>arrive</strong>?
264600	<strong>Who will</strong> <strong>win</strong> the World Cup?
267426	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Itâ€™s possible to ask questions with <strong>might </strong>plus <strong>subject </strong>plus<strong> infinitive</strong>, but you may hear questions with <strong>Do you think </strong>plus<strong> subject </strong>plus <strong>might</strong> plus <strong>infinitive, </strong>like this:
282344	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Do you think it might rain </strong>later?
285706	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now, it's quiz time! Question one. Which is correct?
293520	a) Jane and Joe likely to get married this year or b) Jane and Joe are likely to get married this year?
302496	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer's b) Jane and Joe are likely to get married this year.
309579	Number two. Which is correct?
312442	a) I might not to go to the cinema tonight or b) I might not go to the cinema tonight.
323258	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The correct answer is b) I might not go to the cinema tonight.
327960	Number three. Which is correct?
331670	a) My birthday is likely to be on Saturday next year.
335781	Or b) My birthday will be on Saturday next year.
340833	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is b) My birthday will be on Saturday next year. 29 again, Catherine!
350253	That's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got those right.
353409	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's also the end of the show.
