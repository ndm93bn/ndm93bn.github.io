1	(Introduction...)
11888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello again. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
16000	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And me, Emma. Hello.
17700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In todayâ€™s programme weâ€™re looking at two ways to talk about the future.
23222	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Letâ€™s start with some sample sentences. Rob, can we have an example of a future arrangement?
31222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Sure. Farid is meeting his cousin at the airport on Saturday.
36884	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Thanks Rob. The sentence <strong>Farid is meeting his cousin at the airport on Saturday</strong> describes an arrangement, made between two people, to do a particular activity, at a particular time.
53100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, and we can use present continuous, thatâ€™s <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>am</strong>, <strong>is</strong> or <strong>are</strong> plus <strong>verb i-n-g</strong> to talk about this type of future arrangement.
66333	Now, letâ€™s look at going to. We use <strong>going to</strong> with <strong>an infinitive verb</strong> to talk about future plans â€“ things we intend to do. An example please Rob?
80700	<strong>Rob<br></strong>When I finish university, Iâ€™m going to spend a year travelling.
85522	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Iâ€™m going to spend a year travelling. That sounds like an exciting plan. And another please:
92788	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Simon and Ibrahim are going to spend the whole weekend playing football.
98444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So Simon and Ibrahim have some interesting plans too.
103111	But, do they seem very similar to arrangements, would you say, Emma?
109333	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Well yes, they do. We can often use either the present continuous or going to for future plans.
116666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we could say: <strong>Iâ€™m meeting some friends for a drink tonight</strong>.
122555	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Or you could say: <strong>Iâ€™m going to meet some friends for a drink tonight</strong>.
127722	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But sometimes we can only use going to. Hereâ€™s an example.
132888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Itâ€™s really cold. I think itâ€™s going to snow.
137584	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Itâ€™s going to snow</strong>. That isnâ€™t a plan, and it isnâ€™t an arrangement.
145222	<strong>Emma<br></strong>But the speaker can say whatâ€™s going to happen, based on the present situation â€“ whatever is happening now.
152574	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And to do this, itâ€™s <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>am</strong>, <strong>is</strong> or <strong>are</strong>, plus <strong>going to</strong> plus an infinitive <strong>verb without to</strong>.
163666	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>Youâ€™re listening to BBC learning English.
169000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And weâ€™re looking at present continuous for future arrangements, and going to plus a verb to talk about future plans and arrangements â€“ and things we know are going to happen based on the present situation.
183888	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. So, Finn, are you doing anything interesting tonight?
188557	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, Iâ€™m taking my girlfriend to the theatre and the play is starting at 7 oâ€™clock.
196110	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Ooh very good. What are you <strong>going to [gonna]</strong> see?
199555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Aha! Emma I do believe youâ€™re asking me questions about my future arrangements and plans!
207333	You asked me a yes/no present continuous question:
210888	<strong>Emma<br></strong><strong>Are you doing anything interesting tonight?
213551	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And you asked me a question word <strong>going to</strong> question:
217929	<strong>Emma<br></strong><strong>What are you gonna see?
219600	</strong>Youâ€™re quite right Finn, and I used a special short form of going to that we usually only find in informal spoken English: I said <strong>gonna</strong>.
231551	Gonna. Itâ€™s very common in spoken English. <strong>What are you gonna see?
237141	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. The long form is: What are you going to see?
242100	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And the informal short form is: <strong>What are you gonna see? What are you gonna see?
248400	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, Iâ€™ll tell you later â€“ but first, itâ€™s time for a quiz.
254111	So, question 1: Imagine youâ€™re at a football match.
259600	Your team is playing really well.
261996	Do you say a) Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re going to score a goal!
267425	Or do you say b) Iâ€™m sure they are scoring a goal!
271962	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And the answer is a) <strong>Iâ€™m sure they are going to score a goal!
278333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right â€“ based on the present situation â€“ they are playing well â€“ we can talk about a probable future situation with going to: <strong>Iâ€™m sure they are going to score a goal.
292903	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right, question 2 - which is correct?
295999	a) Weâ€™re gonna going by train.
299710	b) Weâ€™re going go by train.
303274	Or c) Weâ€™re gonna go by train.
307777	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Itâ€™s c) <strong>Weâ€™re gonna go by train</strong>.
312014	Itâ€™s the shorter, spoken form of: Weâ€™re going to go by train.
316760	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, number 3. Which is a correct future sentence: a) Hurry up â€“ the train is leaving.
326415	Or b) Hurry up â€“ the train is going to leave in ten minutes?
331708	<strong>Emma<br></strong>And the correct answer is b) <strong>the train is going to leave in ten minutes.</strong>
338666	Sentence a) needs a time expression to give it future meaning.
343364	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes indeed. Well, Iâ€™m going to leave in a minute, because Iâ€™m going to see a Shakespeare play with my girlfriend. See you next time, Emma!
354666	<strong>Emma<br></strong>Donâ€™t forget - thereâ€™s lots more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
361500	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!
