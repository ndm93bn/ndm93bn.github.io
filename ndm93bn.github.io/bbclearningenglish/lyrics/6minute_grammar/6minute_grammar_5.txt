1	(Introduction...)
12600	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Sophie.
15333	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And with me, Neil. Hello.
20878	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>Todayâ€™s programme is all about the words <strong>may, might</strong> and <strong>could</strong>.
25916	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, weâ€™ll look at how to use these three little words to talk about present and future possibilitiesâ€¦ <strong><br>Sophie <br></strong>Weâ€™ll tell you what to watch out forâ€¦ <br><strong>Neil<br></strong>Weâ€™ll give you a top tip to make your spoken English sound really naturalâ€¦
38826	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>â€¦ and weâ€™ll finish with a quiz.
41026	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So listen carefully!
51002	Now the first thing to say about <strong>may</strong>, <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> is that they are often followed by an infinitive verb without <strong>to</strong>.
59290	And hereâ€™s Catherineâ€¦ Hello!
61418	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello!
61949	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦to bring us our first example.
64007	Catherine, what are you having for dinner tonight?
66854	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I <strong>may make</strong> chicken curry.
70274	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Sounds good.
71597	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦Or I <strong>might have </strong>steakâ€¦<br><br><strong>Neil<br></strong>Even better.
76340	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦Or I <strong>could get</strong> a takeaway.
79182	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Not very healthy - but very convenient.
81398	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>So, tonight Catherine <strong>may have</strong> chicken; she <strong>might have</strong> steak: she <strong>could get</strong> a takeaway.
88827	<strong>May</strong>, <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> with an infinitive show all three options are future possibilities.
95668	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Good. Now those examples were about future possibilities â€“ Catherineâ€™s dinner tonight â€“ but we can also use <strong>may, might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> with an infinitive to talk about present possibilities, like this:<br><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I think Jackie likes chicken - but she <strong>might prefer</strong> fish.
116968	I donâ€™t know where Shaheen is.
120083	He <strong>could be</strong> at work.
121948	The agency <strong>may have</strong> the information you want.
125953	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Right, so that's present and future possibilities.
131004	Now, we can alsoâ€¦ <em>(someone knocks at the door) </em>â€¦er, hello?
137936	<strong>Woman<br></strong>Oops, sorry â€“ wrong studio!
144078	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Who was that?
145278	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>Iâ€™m not sure.
146503	She <strong>may be</strong> from IT.
148060	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Or, she <strong>might be</strong> the new presenter.
151082	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>She <strong>could be</strong> the studio manager.
153942	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Weâ€™re all guessing â€¦<br><strong>Sophie <br></strong>Yes, well, anyway, as I was about to say, we often use <strong>may</strong>, <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong> to make guesses.
171611	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about <strong>may</strong>, <strong>might</strong> and <strong>could</strong>.
175455	Now, for negatives, we use <strong>might not</strong> or<br>or <strong>may not</strong>.
181454	So we can say:<br><strong>Catherine<br></strong>I <strong>might not cook</strong> chicken curry.
186659	I think that woman is the new studio manager â€“ but she <strong>may not be</strong>.
192257	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>The short form of <strong>might not</strong> is <strong>mightnâ€™t</strong>, but this is not so usual.
198955	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦and some people shorten <strong>may not</strong> to <strong>maynâ€™t</strong>, but thatâ€™s unusual too.
203799	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>Now, we promised you a word of warningâ€¦<br><strong>Neil<br></strong>We did.
207428	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>â€¦ and here it is.
208856	The negative of <strong>could</strong> is <strong>couldnâ€™t,</strong> but be very careful with <strong>couldn't</strong> when youâ€™re talking about future possibility or future uncertainty.
219267	Neil, give us an example situation.
222277	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. Imagine youâ€™re in an airport.
224940	Your plane is due to take off in an hour from now, but the weather is getting worse â€“ youâ€™re getting worried.
232376	You might say this:<br><strong>Catherine<br></strong>If the weather gets worse, our plane <strong>could</strong> <strong>take off</strong> late.
238567	We <strong>might not take off</strong> at all!
241016	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now thatâ€™s all fine, but if you say: We <strong>couldnâ€™t take off</strong> â€“ youâ€™re talking about an <br>impossible situation in the past, not an uncertain situation in the future.
253567	So you canâ€™t use<br><strong>couldnâ€™t</strong> in our airport example.
257173	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>So watch out for <strong>couldnâ€™t</strong>.
259937	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes.
260770	Stick with <strong>might not</strong> or <strong>may not</strong> if you want to play it safe here.
264696	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>Now, for questions, you can use <strong>might</strong>, <strong>may</strong> and <strong>could</strong>, but a top tip to make your English sound more natural is to use the phrase <strong>Do you thinkâ€¦?</strong>
275266	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So you can say <strong>Might Catherine have chicken curry for dinner</strong>?
279097	But it sounds more natural to say <strong>Do you think Catherine might have chicken curry for dinner?</strong>
283987	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>So itâ€™s <strong>Do you think</strong>, then a <strong>subject</strong>, then <strong>might</strong>, <strong>may</strong> or <strong>could</strong> plus <strong>infinitive</strong>.
292707	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Sophie, I think we could be ready for our quiz. Number one.
300811	Which is the correct answer to the question: Where are you going on holiday?
305997	Is it a) I may to go to Spain or b) I may go to Spain.
313584	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>Itâ€™s b) I <strong>may go</strong> to Spain.
316583	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. Number two. Which is correct?
319752	The traffic is getting worse, so a) I may not be home on time or b) I could not be home on time.
328910	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>Itâ€™s a) The traffic is getting worse, so I <strong>may not be</strong> home on time.
334620	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the last one. Which sounds more natural?
337967	a) Might we have to go now or b) Do you <br>think we might have to go now?
343610	<strong>Sophie <br></strong>Itâ€™s b) Do you think we might have to go now?
348506	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well done if you got those right and yes, we do have to go now.
