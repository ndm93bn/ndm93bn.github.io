1	(Introduction...)
14112	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
17950	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And me, Rob. Hello.
19390	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Today we're talking about indirect questions.
22542	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's right: Indirect questions.
24879	We'll tell you what they are, how to make them and when to use them
28613	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There'll a quiz at the end of the show, so listen carefully.
31949	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Let's start with a simple question. Catherine: What time is it?
36839	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is 18 minutes past 11, Rob.
41324	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And that question uses normal question word order. What â€“ time â€“ is â€“ it?
47294	But there's another way to ask that question. Let's listen to Mike:
51003	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Could you tell me what the time is?
53546	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, it's still 18 minutes past 11! Thanks Mike.
57071	This is a much more polite way of asking a question.
60370	It's called an <strong>indirect question</strong> and it has two parts.
64137	The first part is the phrase <strong>Could you tell meâ€¦</strong>
67525	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ and the second part is the question word <strong>what</strong> with the information we want to know.
73279	Here it is again:
74475	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Could you tell me what time it is?
77712	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And there are lots of phrases that we can use in the first part of an indirect question.
83540	Here are some of them:
85011	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Do you knowâ€¦.?
86624	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Do you know when the film finishes?
89834	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Have you any idea?
92672	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Have you any idea where I left my phone?
96516	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Would you mind telling me â€¦?
99067	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Would you mind telling me how this machine works?
103042	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now, let's get a closer look at the second part of indirect questions.
107805	And it's important to note that we don't use question word order.
112112	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, the subject and verb are in the same order as they are in statements.
117315	So, we don't say <strong>Can you tell me what time is it?</strong>
121606	We say <strong>Can you tell me what time it is?
125900	It's subject - <strong>it</strong> - plus verb - <strong>is</strong>.
129622	Listen out for the statement word order in these indirect questions:
133726	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Do you know when the film finishes? Have you any idea where I left my phone?
141232	Would you mind telling me how this machine works?
145609	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>One more time please?
147853	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Do you know when the film finishes? Have you any idea where I left my phone?
155087	Would you mind telling me how this machine works?
159603	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thanks Mike now, let's talk about yes - no questions.
164507	Here are some <strong>direct</strong> questions.
166647	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Is this coffee for everyone? Does the canteen open for breakfast?
173452	Can I use this computer?
176853	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, listen to the <strong>indirect</strong> questions.
180762	They use statement word order again, so listen out for that, and also listen out for the two words that come after the part one phrases.
191515	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Do you know if this coffee is for everyone? Do you know if the canteen opens for breakfast?
199392	Do you know whether I can use this computer?
204214	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>One more time please?
206655	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Do you know if this coffee is for everyone? Do you know if the canteen opens for breakfast?
214531	Do you know whether I can use this computer?
219269	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, use <strong>if</strong> or <strong>whether</strong> in yes - no questions.
224310	The meaning is the same, but <strong>whether</strong> is a bit more formal than <strong>if</strong>.
228505	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English dot com.
234050	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And we're talking about indirect questions.
236643	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, and we use indirect questions a lot in English, especially when we are talking to people we don't know.
243164	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Let's recap: there are two types of indirect questions: those that use question words like <strong>what, where, when, why</strong> and <strong>how</strong> â€¦
252522	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ and those that use <strong>if </strong>or <strong>whether</strong>.
255344	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But all indirect questions have the same word order as statements.
259888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>They do. Now, a quick word about tenses. Listen to these direct questions.
265193	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Does this programme finish soon? Did a package arrive for me this morning?
271782	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The first question was in the present simple tense.
275486	We had the auxiliary <strong>does</strong> with the verb <strong>finish</strong>.
278850	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And the second question was in the simple past, with the auxiliary <strong>did</strong> and the verb <strong>arrive</strong>.
285993	Let's hear the indirect questions now.
288284	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Can you tell me if this programme finishes soon?
292394	Could you tell me if a package arrived for me this morning?
296473	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, no <strong>does</strong> or <strong>did</strong> in the indirect questions.
300991	In the first question, it's <strong>finishes</strong> in the present simple.
305385	<strong>Rob<br></strong>â€¦and in the second question, it's <strong>arrived</strong>, in the past simple.
309986	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Simple!
312501	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now: it's quiz time. Number one. Which is correct?
316165	Is it a) Can you tell me where the coffee machine is?
320032	Or b) Can you tell me where is the coffee machine?
324319	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's a) Can you tell me where the coffee machine is?
328785	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. Number two.
330467	a) Do you know if this machine does give change?
334141	Or b) Do you know if this machine gives change?
338294	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's b) Do you know if this machine gives change?
342987	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And number three. Have you any idea what the time is?
347697	Or b) Have you any idea what is the time is?
351507	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's a) Have you any idea what the time is?
355758	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well actually, it's time for the end of the show. Well done if you got those right.
