1	(Introduction...)
11850	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello again. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
15957	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And me, Alice. Hello.
17807	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Todayâ€™s programme is all about the present perfect tenseâ€¦
22011	<strong>Alice<br></strong>â€¦and how to use it with the words <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already </strong>and <strong>yet</strong>.
26809	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right, and thereâ€™ll be a quiz for you at the end to see how much you remember.
31930	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. So letâ€™s get started!
34636	Now, the present perfect with <strong>just</strong>â€¦ [sound of mobile phone ringing] Oh, hold onâ€¦ Sorry.
41175	<strong>Hamish (on the phone)</strong><em><br></em>Hey Alice. Itâ€™s Hamish, yeah, I'm here!
45287	Iâ€™ve just arrived at Kings Cross Station.
47783	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Ohâ€¦Kingâ€™s Crossâ€¦ Kingâ€™s Cross here? In London?
51900	<strong>Hamish (on the phone)<br></strong>Yeah, London town. Here I am! My train got in an hour ago.
55851	Iâ€™ve already visited Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Squareâ€¦
60052	<strong>Alice<br></strong>What, already?
61633	<strong>Hamish (on the phone)<br></strong>Yeah, but I havenâ€™t been on the London Eye yet.
66054	I want to go there next. Can you meet me in there in 10 minutes?
70362	<strong>Alice<br></strong>(To Hamish) Sorry Hamish, weâ€™ve just started the programmeâ€¦ (To Finn) Sorry about thatâ€¦
75627	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Don't worry, Alice, those were great examples of the present perfect with <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong>!
82270	And hereâ€™s Catherine, helloâ€¦
83946	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello.
84580	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦to repeat those examples for us. Catherine.
87018	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Iâ€™ve just arrived at Kings Cross Station.
90570	Iâ€™ve already visited Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square.
95189	But I havenâ€™t been on the London Eye yet.
98346	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, you may have spotted that the sentences with <strong>just </strong>and <strong>already</strong> are positive, but the sentence with <strong>yet</strong> is negative.
108220	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes: we use <strong>just</strong> and <strong>already</strong> mainly in positive sentences.
113299	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And <strong>yet</strong> in negative sentences, and in questions.
117980	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Ok. Now letâ€™s look at some other differences between <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong>.
123519	<strong>Finn<br></strong>First: we use <strong>just </strong>with the present perfect for something that happened only a short time ago â€“ <strong>Hamish</strong> <strong>has just phoned</strong>.
132418	<strong>Heâ€™s just arrived</strong> in London.
134813	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And <strong>Iâ€™ve just told</strong> him to call back later.
138172	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now we use <strong>already</strong> with the present perfect when an action has happened before now - or before we expected it to happen.
147092	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, <strong>Hamish has already been</strong> to Buckingham Palace!
151372	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Now letâ€™s look at word order.
154327	Both <strong>just</strong> and <strong>already</strong> come between the auxiliary and the past participle.
159865	Catherine, can we have some examples again, please:
163719	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hamish has just phoned. Heâ€™s already visited Buckingham Palace.
169521	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Thanks Catherine.
171544	<strong>Hamish (on the phone)<br></strong>Hey Alice, itâ€™s me â€“ Hamish â€“ again. Soâ€¦
175773	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Iâ€™m sorry, Hamish. Iâ€™ve already told you.
178605	Iâ€™m doing 6 Minute Grammar. Iâ€™ll call you in a few minutes.
182271	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Great! Another example of <strong>already</strong>, Alice!
186177	<strong>Iâ€™ve already told you</strong>.
188401	<strong>Hamish (on the phone)<br></strong>(can't hear what he says)
189440	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Have I finished yet? No, sorry, we havenâ€™t finished yet. Byeâ€¦
193795	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hamish?
195705	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hamish againâ€¦ Aha! He asked: <strong>"Have you finished yet?"</strong>
200946	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And you said: <strong>"We havenâ€™t finished yet."</strong>
204276	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, <strong>yet</strong> with present perfect.
206824	We use <strong>yet </strong>to<strong> </strong>ask if something has happened before now â€“ or to say something has not happened up to now.
214186	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So: thatâ€™s <strong>yet</strong> for negative sentences or questions with the present perfect.
219954	And <strong>yet</strong> always comes at the end of the sentence.
223963	By the way, Alice, <strong>we havenâ€™t explained how to form the present perfect yet.
230052	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Youâ€™re right, Finn.
231409	So, we make the present perfect with the <strong>subject </strong>plus<strong> have, has, havenâ€™t, hasnâ€™t and the past participle.
240779	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Remember, we put <strong>just</strong> and <strong>already</strong> between <strong>have </strong>or<strong> has</strong> and the <strong>past participle</strong>.
247924	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And we put <strong>yet </strong>at the end of a negative sentence or question.
252521	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>Youâ€™re listening to BBC Learning English.
257815	<strong>Hamish (on the phone)<br></strong>(can't hear what he says)<strong> </strong>
264570	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hamish?
265835	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hamish. Heâ€™s in reception.
267904	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Has he got here <strong>already</strong>? That was quick.
272079	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So, sometimes we can put <strong>already</strong> at the end of a question to show surprise.
277405	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I think it's time for a quiz now! Number one.
283776	Iâ€™m going to say a sentence and you have to fill in the gap. Here goes.
289493	I havenâ€™t seen Spiderman 2 ______.
294989	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Itâ€™s I havenâ€™t seen Spiderman 2 <strong>yet</strong>.
299395	Because you havenâ€™t seen the film before now.
302641	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Correct. Number 2: Hamish has only been in London for one hour and heâ€˜s ______ been to Trafalgar Square.
313499	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Itâ€™s <strong>already</strong>. Because we are stressing the fact that heâ€™s done something before we expected it.
319682	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Great. Now, question 3.
321995	[Phone rings] Your phone has ______ rung.
328861	<strong>Alice<br>Just</strong>.
330587	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No, really, your phone has just rung.
334965	Pass me the phone, Aliceâ€¦ Hamish, Alice has just told you that we havenâ€™t finished <strong>yet</strong>!
343042	Oh, oh, sorryâ€¦
344538	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Whatâ€™s the matter?
346203	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Itâ€™s not Hamish - itâ€™s your mum!
348256	<strong>Alice <br></strong>Finn! Never mind.
