1	(Introduction...)
11232	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
15252	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.
17413	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Today's programme is about question tags, <strong>isn't it</strong> Finn?
21961	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, it is Catherine.
23842	And, a question tag â€“ also known as a tag question â€“ is a short yes/no question that we put at the end of a statement.
33436	Here's an example. Catherine, you live near the station, <strong>don't you?
38405	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I live very near the station, Finn.
40450	It's about five minutes from my house.
42705	The question tag Finn used was <strong>don't you</strong>?
46881	Finn thinks he knows where I live, but he wants to check.
50456	He checks by saying a statement, then adding a short question at the end.
56054	Here's Neil with some more examples.
58678	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Mike's working from home today, <strong>isn't he?
62212	The kids haven't forgotten to do their homework, <strong>have they?
67111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, forming question tags can be a little tricky, so here are some useful tips:
74884	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Tip number one: when the statement is positive, the question tag is negative.
80131	The statement <strong>You live near the station </strong>is positiveâ€¦
85011	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we add a negative question tag: <strong>don't you.
90825	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Tip two: When the statement is negative, the question tag is positive.
95899	Here's a negative statement: <strong>You didn't eat all the chocolate</strong>â€¦
100697	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ with a positive question tag: <strong>did you?
104430	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Actually Finn, talking about chocolateâ€¦ I left some chocolate her, before.
110352	<strong>You haven't seen it, have you?
111380	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Chocolate, no.
113343	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Are you sure?
114854	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No - <strong>I think you had it with your coffee, didn't you?
117937	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hmm. I'm not sure I did, actually.
121149	Anyway, moving on. Tip three.
123939	Question tags aren't complete questions: a question tag has just an auxiliary verb and a subject.
131593	There isn't a main verb in a question tag.
134027	For example, question tags are: are youâ€¦ did theyâ€¦
139026	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ don't youâ€¦ isn't heâ€¦
142255	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And so on. Now for tip four: the auxiliary verb can be positive or negative. Here's Neil.
149969	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You're lying, <strong>aren't you?â€¦</strong>
152706	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We have a positive auxiliary verb - <strong>are</strong> - in the statementâ€¦
157428	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ so we make it negative â€“ <strong>aren't</strong> â€“ in the question tag.
162499	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>A negative auxiliary verb in the statement becomes positive in the tag. Neil.
168361	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>You aren't lying, are you?
170535	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you. Tip five.
172450	If there isn't an auxiliary verb in the statement, use the auxiliary verb <strong>do</strong> in the question tag.
179078	Here are some examples:
181306	<strong>Neil<br></strong>They always go by bus, <strong>don't they?</strong>
183722	You ate my chocolate, <strong>didn't you?
186853	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Don't remind me of chocolate.
189825	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I'm not guilty!
191589	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that's auxiliary verbs in question tags.
194740	Our next question tags tip is that the subject and tense of the question tag and statement are always the same.
203333	So when I say: <strong>Finn, you didn't eat my chocolate, did you?</strong>
208904	The subject is <strong>you</strong> in the statement and question tag.
213844	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the tense is past simple in both.
219093	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
223142	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We're talking about question tagsâ€¦
225757	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ and the mystery of my missing chocolate, Finn!
228848	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ooh, well! Before that, a word about speaking.
233277	Question tags are used mostly in spoken English.
237506	We don't use them much in writing.
240299	And there are two main reasons to use them in speaking.
243882	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>First, use question tags to get someone to confirm something that we think we already know.
252264	For example, Finnâ€¦ I definitely saw you eating something earlierâ€¦ <strong>You were eating my chocolate, weren't you!?
261789	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Wellâ€¦
262685	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Weren't you?!
264242	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, yes I was! Catherine, I'll get you some more, I'm sorry. I promise.
270396	<strong>It's not easy to resist chocolate, is it?
273944	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Clearly. Clearly not!
275457	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And if you were listening carefully, you probably noticed that Catherine's voice went down, from high to low, when she said the question tag.
284898	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>You were eating my chocolate, weren't you!?
288766	â€¦weren't you!?
290567	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And that falling intonation means that Catherine thinks that what she is saying is correct.
297468	She wants me to confirm it. Or just make conversation.
301584	But when someone uses rising intonation in a question tag - when the voice goes up - they are asking a real question â€“ they want to find out if the statement is really true.
313560	For example, you could say:
316065	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>There isn't any meat in the soup, is there?
319066	<strong>You do serve vegetarian food, don't you?
322833	<strong>I can order a plain omelette, can't I?
326321	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now it's quiz time.
328678	I'm going to say three statements and you have to add the question tags.
332774	Number one: It's your birthday tomorrowâ€¦
336537	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦isn't it?
337762	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good, number two: Kumar won't be lateâ€¦
341457	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦will he?
343277	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Question three: You're going to get that chocolate nowâ€¦?
348147	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦aren't you? Ok Catherine, I get the hint.
352483	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done if you got all those right.
