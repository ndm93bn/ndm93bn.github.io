1	(Introduction...)
11500	<strong>Callum</strong> <br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.
14844	<strong>Finn</strong> <br> And me, Finn.
16400	<strong>Callum</strong> <br> Todayâ€™s programme is all about the future perfect verb form.
20400	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Yes, by the end of this programme, <strong>you</strong> <strong>will have learnt</strong> how and when to use this form.
26300	<strong>Callum</strong> <br> So there was our first example: <strong>you will have learnt.
30850	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Youâ€™ll hear lots more examples in the programmeâ€¦
33600	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>And weâ€™ll have a quiz. Now, we usually use the future perfect to talk about an event that we predict or expect to happen or finish before a particular time in the future. Listen to this example from Feifei.
51666	<strong>Feifei<br> </strong>By the time Christine arrives, <strong>weâ€™ll have had</strong> dinner.
54900	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>So <strong>weâ€™ll have had, </strong>thatâ€™s<strong> we will have had - </strong>in the future perfect tells us that we will finish dinner before Christine gets back.
65777	We might be having dinner right up to just before she returns or we might finish it an hour before â€¦
73000	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>â€¦ but in any case, we will finish <strong>before</strong> she arrives.
77777	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>We are using the future perfect to make a prediction about the future. Here are some more examples.
83533	<strong>Feifei<br> </strong>This time next year, <strong>I will have finished</strong> my course.
87000	Sales <strong>will have increased</strong> by 20 per cent by next January.
91055	By 2020 the cityâ€™s population <strong>will have doubled</strong>.
95200	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Now we usually use a time phrase with the future perfect, often with <strong>by</strong> or <strong>in</strong>.
101100	Letâ€™s hear examples with <strong>by</strong> again:
103999	<strong>Feifei<br> </strong>Sales will have increased by 20 per cent <strong>by next January</strong>.
108300	<strong>By 2020</strong> the cityâ€™s population will have doubled.
112300	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And here are some more examples with a <strong>by</strong> time phrase.
116999	<strong>Feifei<br> By the summer</strong> Iâ€™ll have finished all my exams.
120680	Weâ€™ll have moved house <strong>by Christmas</strong>.
123440	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>So we had <strong>by next January, by 2020,</strong> <strong>by the summer</strong> and <strong>by Christmas</strong>.
130933	We can also say <strong>by the winterâ€¦ by the end of the weekâ€¦
134666	<strong>Finn<br> â€¦by next month </strong>or<strong> next yearâ€¦ by this time next weekâ€¦
139800	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>In fact you can pretty well use <strong>byâ€¦</strong> with any future date, month, season or special day.
146333	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Very special day. Another time expression with <strong>by</strong> we can use with the future perfect is <strong>by the time thatâ€¦</strong>plus a subject and verb.
156222	Listen to the example we had earlier, and check out the tense.
160700	<strong>Feifei<br> </strong>By the time Christine arrives, weâ€™ll have had dinner.
163666	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Itâ€™s the present simple - <strong>arrives.</strong>
166444	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>When we use <strong>in</strong> for a time phrase with the future perfect, we can use it with a day, a month, a date, a time period. Here are some examples.
176555	<strong>Feifei<br> In fifty years' time</strong>, sea levels will have risen by several centimetres.
181555	<strong>In June</strong> Iâ€™ll have been unemployed for five months.
185400	<strong>In 2050</strong>, I believe robots will have replaced sales assistants in shops.
191040	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>As well as for future plans and predictions, we can also use the future perfect to talk about what we believe or imagine has or hasnâ€™t happened at the moment of speakingâ€¦
203100	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>â€¦or in other words, to make educated guesses in the present about the past. Here are some examples.
211222	<strong>Feifei<br> </strong>Thereâ€™s no point in calling Judy.<strong>Sheâ€™ll have left </strong>by now. Letâ€™s hurry!
216400	The film <strong>wonâ€™t have started</strong> yet. If heâ€™s on schedule, Tom <strong>will have arrived in Bangkok </strong>yesterday.
223555	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>So we assume that Judy has already leftâ€¦.
226600	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And the film hasnâ€™t started.
229100	<strong>Callum</strong><br> And Tom has arrived in Bangkok.
231500	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Now, to form the future perfect we use <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>will </strong>or<strong> wonâ€™t </strong>plus <strong>have </strong>and the <strong>past participle </strong>of the main verb.
242188	<strong>Feifei<br> </strong>By the summer <strong>Iâ€™ll have finished</strong> all my exams. The film <strong>wonâ€™t have started</strong> yet.
247333	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Notice that we usually use short forms, so itâ€™s <strong>Iâ€™ll</strong>, <strong>heâ€™ll</strong>, <strong>theyâ€™ll</strong> and so on; and <strong>will not</strong> becomes <strong>wonâ€™t</strong>.
256888	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>For questions, itâ€™s <strong>will</strong> or <strong>wonâ€™t</strong> plus <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>have</strong> plus the <strong>past participle</strong>.
262999	<strong>Feifei<br> Will you have finished</strong> reading all the reports by this afternoon?
266055	<strong>IDENT<br> </strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.
271222	<strong>Finn <br> </strong>We're talking about the future perfect verb form.
274900	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>So, to recap, we use the future perfect to predict events that will have happened before a particular time in the futureâ€¦
283333	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>â€¦and to make educated guesses about things happening around now and even in the past.
289600	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>And we usually use short forms.
292000	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So, itâ€™s time for our quiz. Which is correct?
297040	Number one. a) By 2060, scientists will have found a cure for cancer.
303550	b) By 2060, scientists will found a cure for cancer.
310999	<strong>Callum</strong><br> Itâ€™s a) By 2060, scientists will have found a cure for cancer.
316999	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>I hope so, now number 2. a) Jackie wonâ€™t have woken up yet. Itâ€™s too early.
324111	b) Jackie wonâ€™t have wake up yet. Itâ€™s too early.
331222	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Itâ€™s a) Jackie wonâ€™t have woken up yet. Itâ€™s too early.
336111	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Finally, number three. a) Will have you done all your work by two?
342050	b) Will you have done all your work by two?
347600	<strong>Callum</strong><br> And the answer is b) Will you have done all your work by two?
352629	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Thatâ€™s correct and itâ€™s the end of the show.
