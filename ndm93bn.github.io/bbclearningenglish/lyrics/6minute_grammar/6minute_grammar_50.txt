1	(Introduction...)
12912	<strong>Catherine</strong><strong> </strong><strong> <br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
16300	<strong>Finn <br></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.
18400	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>In this programme we're talking about adjectives and adverbs.
22100	<strong>Finn <br></strong>We'll tell you what they are and how theyâ€™re used.
25500	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>We'll give you some tips to help you understand the difference between them.
29008	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we'll also have a quiz to test your understanding.
32700	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Right. Let's get started. Finn, can you tell us about adjectives first.
38500	<strong>Finn <br></strong>OK. Certainly, let's start with a simple example. What am I holding up?
45354	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>You've got two biscuits, Finn . One is <strong>plain </strong>and one is <strong>chocolate</strong>.
50630	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Yes. Do you like both?
52300	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I do.
53134	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Me too. In that sentence there were two adjectives, <strong>plain </strong>and <strong>chocolate</strong>. What do those words do?
62000	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Well, Finn. Those words describe the biscuits.
64900	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>That's right. Adjectives are describing words: they tell us about nouns.
70700	In this case they tell us about the biscuits.
74100	A <strong>plain </strong>biscuit. A <strong>chocolate </strong>biscuit.
77100	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Fantastic. What else do adjectives describe?
80000	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Lots of things. They can also describe pronouns.
84300	Listen out for the adjective <strong>happy</strong> in this example. Here's Neil
89053	<strong>Neil <br></strong>Peter played well. After the game he was happy.
93600	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>The adjective <strong>happy</strong> - what did that refer to?
97500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It referred to the pronoun <strong>he</strong>, which in this example was Peter.
102600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, Peter was <strong>happy</strong>.
105000	He was <strong>happy</strong>. He was a <strong>happy</strong> Peter.
108100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So adjectives are words that give us information or additional information about nouns.
113900	When it comes to adverbs there is a bit of a clue in the name, isn't there, Finn?
119950	Ad â€“ verb, add information about a verb.
124300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That is one thing that adverbs do. They give us information about verbs.
129700	They can tell us how someone does something or how something happens. Now, let's listen again to the example.
136700	As well as the adjective <strong>happy </strong>there's also an adverb in the sentence. What is it?
142754	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Peter played <strong>well</strong>. After the game he was <strong>happy</strong>.
147491	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The adverb there was <strong>well</strong>. Peter played <strong>well</strong>.
152100	The word <strong>well</strong> isn't describing Peter himself: it's describing how he did what he did.
159590	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
166000	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And we're talking about adjectives and adverbs.
169200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We've seen that adjectives describe nouns and adverbs talk about verbs.
175000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You mentioned that referring to verbs was only one thing that adverbs do.
180500	So, where else can we use them?
182400	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Adverbs can also describe adjectives, and even other adverbs. Remember the biscuits?
190360	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>I'm looking at them right now, Finn.
192400	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Look good, donâ€™t they?
193400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>They do!
194100	<strong>Finn <br></strong>What do you feel when you see the biscuits?
196770	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I feel hungry!
198009	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Is hungry an adjective or adverb?
201700	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>It is an adjective because it's describing me, my feeling â€“ and I'm a noun!
206880	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You are a noun! And now if I ask you how hungry you are, what would you say?
212700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well the chocolate biscuit in particular is making me feel <strong>very</strong> hungry.
217300	<strong>Finn<br> Very</strong> hungry. <strong>Very</strong>. Hungry.
221312	What is the word <strong>very </strong>referring to? Is it you, the noun?
225900	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>No, it's the adjective <strong>hungry</strong>.
229300	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Exactly. <strong> Very </strong>is an adverb.
232600	So as well as adding information about verbs, adverbs can also tell us about adjectives.
239200	And they can even tell us about other adverbs. Let's hear our earlier example again please, Neil?
246000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Peter played well. After the game he was happy.
250850	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Remember that the word <strong>well</strong> is an adverb.
253900	But how <strong>well</strong> did Peter play?
255800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Peter played <strong>really</strong> <strong>well</strong>.
258100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. So here the word <strong>really </strong>is telling us about the adverb <strong>well</strong>.
264234	How <strong>well</strong>?
265327	<strong>Really</strong> <strong>well</strong>. <strong>Really </strong>is also an adverb.
268800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So adverbs can tell us about verbs, adjectives and other adverbs.
274900	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And adjectives describe nouns and pronouns. And now, it's quiz time.
283804	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We are going to give you a word, and read a sentence which contains the word.
288900	You need to decide if the word we give you is an adjective or an adverb.
294300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK. So, here's the first one.
296850	The word is <strong>blue</strong> and here's the sentence.
299800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The sky is dark <strong>blue</strong>. The sky is dark <strong>blue</strong>.
305183	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, is <strong>blue</strong> an adjective or adverb?
309000	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Itâ€™s an adjective. <strong>Blue</strong> is describing the noun sky.
313842	Now number two: it's actually the same sentence but this time, think about the word <strong>dark</strong>.
321500	Is <strong>dark</strong> an adjective or an adverb?
324915	<strong>Finn<br></strong>The sky is <strong>dark</strong> blue.
327700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. So, is <strong>dark</strong> an adjective or adverb?
331700	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Dark</strong> here is an adverb.
334687	Now number three. This time there are three words to listen out for: <strong>delicious</strong>, <strong>very</strong> and <strong>slowly</strong> â€“ are they adjectives or adverbs?
343800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Catherine ate the <strong>delicious</strong> biscuit <strong>very</strong> <strong>slowly</strong>.
347876	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No, she didn't. She ate it very fast. But, did you get them?
352000	<strong>Delicious</strong> is an adjective. It describes the noun biscuit.
356002	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Slowly </strong>is an adverb.
358200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And finally, <strong>very</strong> is also an adverb.
361300	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that's our introduction to adjectives and adverbs
364502	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
