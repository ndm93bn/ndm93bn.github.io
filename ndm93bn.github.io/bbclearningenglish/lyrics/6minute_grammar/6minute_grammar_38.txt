1	(Introduction...)
11900	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Alice.
15166	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.
17333	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Today we're talking about verb patterns.
20022	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes: we're looking at what happens when we use two verbs together in English.
25666	<strong>Alice<br></strong>We'll be looking at four verb patterns - and there's a quiz at the end of the programme - so listen carefully!
31722	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, on with the show! Our first pattern is: <strong>verb plus gerund</strong>.
40000	<strong>Alice<br></strong>A <strong>gerund</strong> is the <strong>i-n-g</strong> form of a verb - words like <strong>seeing</strong>, <strong>complaining</strong> and <strong>giving</strong> are all gerunds.
49222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And here's Catherine to give us some examples of the pattern verb plus gerund. Catherine.
57810	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I really <strong>enjoyed seeing</strong> Rachel again last night.
61999	Jackie <strong>kept complaining</strong>, so I went home.
67444	Would you <strong>mind giving</strong> me a lift to the station?
70222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thanks Catherine. So we had the verb <strong>enjoy</strong> plus the gerund <strong>seeing</strong>.
76444	<strong>Alice<br></strong>We had <strong>keep</strong> plus <strong>complaining</strong>.
79714	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the verb <strong>mind</strong> plus the gerund <strong>giving</strong>.
83777	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Good. <strong>Enjoy seeing; keep complaining; mind giving</strong>.
89900	Other verbs that can be followed by gerunds include: <strong>finish</strong>, <strong>practise</strong>, <strong>suggest</strong>, and <strong>recommend</strong>.
99333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So I can say: I <strong>suggest keeping</strong> a list of verbs that take gerunds.
105900	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Haha, good example.
108111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thank you.
108727	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Now for the second pattern: <strong>verb plus infinitive</strong>.
112995	An infinitive is the word <strong>to</strong> plus a base verb, for example: <strong>to see</strong>, <strong>to drive</strong>,<strong> to study</strong>. Some examples please Catherine?
123922	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I really <strong>want to see</strong> the football tonight.
127666	My brother's <strong>learning to drive</strong>.
130800	Mario's <strong>hoping to study</strong> medicine.
133850	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So that's: <strong>want to see</strong>, <strong>learning to drive</strong>, <strong>hoping to study</strong>.
140555	Other verbs in this group are <strong>agree</strong>, <strong>decide</strong>, <strong>choose</strong> and <strong>learn.</strong>
147555	Now for the third pattern: these verbs can be followed by either a gerund or an infinitive - without changing the meaning. Some examples please Catherine.
159202	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I've <strong>started learning</strong> Arabic - and my boyfriend's <strong>started to learn</strong> French.
165132	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So <strong>started learning</strong> and <strong>started to learn</strong> have more or less the same meaning. Now, another example please?
174383	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Snow will <strong>continue to fall</strong> in the mountains and temperatures will <strong>continue falling</strong> throughout the night.
181300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So <strong>continue to fall</strong> and <strong>continue falling</strong> have the same meaning.
187610	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK. Time for pattern 4.
190222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes - and this one's a bit tricky.
193111	With some verbs, you can use either a gerund or an infinitive afterwards, BUT.
199444	<strong>Alice<br></strong>...and it's a big but.
201444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes...the meaning changes from gerund to infinitive.
206000	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So if I say. I <strong>stopped drinking coffee</strong> last week.
211000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, I probably wouldn't believe you.
214100	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, well...this means I drank coffee regularly in the past, but last week, I decided to give up coffee.
223333	I completely stopped and now I never drink coffee.
226888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But, if I say, on my way home yesterday, I <strong>stopped to have</strong> a cup of coffee.
233888	<strong>Alice<br></strong>This means that yesterday you interrupted your journey and you went into a cafe for a cup of coffee.
240444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, very different meanings.
242482	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes. Here's an example, with the verb <strong>remember</strong>:
245969	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We <strong>remembered closing</strong> the door.
248845	We <strong>remembered to close</strong> the door.
251828	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK, in the first one, we formed a picture in our mind of us closing the door.
258980	The second example means we didn't forget to close the door.
263940	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.
269555	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And it's time for a quiz. Question one.
272875	Which is correct: a) They <strong>decided taking</strong> the train - or b) They <strong>decided to take</strong> the train.
282852	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK, so this is: b) They <strong>decided to take</strong> the train.
288048	After decide, we need the infinitive.
291222	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Number 2: a) Catherine <strong>hates cooking</strong> in the evening.
296568	b) Catherine <strong>hates to cook</strong> in the evening.
300250	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And that's a trick question.
303617	They are actually both correct, because after hate, you can use either a gerund or an infinitive.
310777	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes you can. Finally, number 3: is it a) Do you <strong>want to go</strong> for a coffee?
317057	Or b) Do you <strong>want going</strong> for a coffee?
320741	<strong>Finn<br></strong>This one is: a) Do you <strong>want to go</strong> for a coffee?
324791	Because after want you need the infinitive...but Alice?
329521	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes?
330516	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You said you'd stopped drinking coffee?!
333222	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh yes I did. Never mind.
337585	Thanks for listening and don't forget - there's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
