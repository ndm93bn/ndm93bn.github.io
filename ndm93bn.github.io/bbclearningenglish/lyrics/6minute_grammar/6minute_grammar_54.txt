1	(Introduction...)
12150	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
15847	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And me, Neil. Hello.
21927	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Today weâ€™re talking about the present perfect and the past simple tenses.
26981	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes â€“ weâ€™re going to tell you how to form them, and give you three rules to help you decide which one to use and when.
34439	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ weâ€™ll also look at using <strong>ever </strong>and <strong>never </strong>with the present perfectâ€¦.
39062	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦and weâ€™ll finish with a quiz.
43244	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right then: letâ€™s start with the present perfect. And hereâ€™s our first example:
49040	<strong>Example<br></strong><strong>I've looked at the sales figures. Theyâ€™ve shot up by 20%!
54530	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, itâ€™s <strong>subject</strong>, plus <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong><em>, </em>plus a <strong>past participle</strong>.
61777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>To make past participles of regular verbs, add <em>-</em><strong>ed</strong> to the main verbâ€¦ so <strong>look</strong> becomes <strong>looked.
70077	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But some verbs, like <strong>shoot</strong>, are irregular.
75481	The past participle of <strong>shoot</strong> is <strong>shot</strong>.
79607	You just have to learn your irregular verbs.
82274	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. And we often use short forms in the present perfect, like <strong>Iâ€™ve, heâ€™s, </strong>and<strong> theyâ€™ve.
90340	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, here's an example of the past simple.
93338	<strong>Example<br></strong><strong>I looked at the sales figures this morning. They shot up by 20% last month.
99886	<strong>Neil<br></strong>For the past simple of regular verbs, add <em>-</em><strong>ed</strong> to the main verbâ€¦
105154	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So <strong>look</strong> becomes <strong>looked</strong>, but donâ€™t forget those irregular verbs.
110165	The past simple of <strong>go</strong> is <strong>went</strong>.
112757	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now itâ€™s often difficult to know which tense to use.
116515	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It can be so weâ€™ve got some rules for you. Listen to the first example again:
121910	<strong>Example<br></strong><strong>Iâ€™ve looked at the sales figures. Theyâ€™ve shot up by 20%.
127712	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s present perfect here because weâ€™re focusing on <strong>what</strong> happened, not <strong>when</strong>.
134062	But in the second example:
136469	<strong>Example<br></strong><strong>I looked at the sales figures this morning. They shot up by 20% last month.
142554	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ itâ€™s the <strong>past simple</strong> because we say <strong>when</strong> the actions happened.
148788	So thatâ€™s rule 1: use the present perfect to say <strong>what</strong> happened, but the past simple for <strong>when</strong> or <strong>where</strong> something happened.
157049	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. Now Neil just a minute because I actuallyâ€¦ <strong>I havenâ€™t eaten this morningâ€¦</strong>
161254	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And thatâ€™s an example of the present perfect with a time phrase.
166105	So sometimes, we <strong>can</strong> use the present perfect to say when something happened, when a situation started in the past and <strong>is still true, or still happening</strong> now.
175274	Here you goâ€¦ Hereâ€™s a biscuit Catherineâ€¦
177955	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you, Neil.
178414	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ because you havenâ€™t eaten anything this morningâ€¦
180157	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ I havenâ€™t. But, if I said, <strong>I didnâ€™t eat anything this morning</strong><em>, </em>with the past simple, it would mean it isnâ€™t morning any more â€“ now, itâ€™s the afternoon or eveningâ€¦
190761	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, the action started and finished in the pastâ€¦ and you must be starving â€“ go on, have another biscuit!
197305	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you very much.
198556	So thatâ€™s rule 2: use the present perfect for events that started in the past and are <strong>continuing nowâ€¦</strong>
206578	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦and the past simple for actions that started and finished in the past.
211038	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Nice biscuits, Neil.
212275	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.
218225	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about when to use the present perfect and the past simple.
222757	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, we often use the present perfect with <strong>ever</strong> and <strong>never</strong><em>â€¦</em> for life experiences â€“ things weâ€™ve done at some point in the past.
230528	Hereâ€™s a question for you<em>, </em>Catherine.
232323	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Okayâ€¦
233235	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Have you ever eaten </strong>insects?
235981	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Funnily enough, Neil,no,<strong> Iâ€™ve never eaten </strong>an insect, and I don't think I ever will. How about you?
243444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, actually<strong> I have eaten </strong>insects.
245680	I've eaten ants that were given to me by a friend from Colombia.
250950	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very good. So, rule 3: use <strong>ever</strong> with the present perfect to <strong>ask</strong> about a past experience, and <strong>never</strong> to talk about an experience you <strong>havenâ€™t</strong> had.
262503	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ but if you add information about time and place, use the past simple <em>â€“ </em><strong>I ate insects last summer in Colombia.
270140	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ and Neil used present perfect in <strong>I have eaten insects </strong>because he was focusing on the event itself, not when it happened.
279528	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Actually, I wasnâ€™t focussing on anything. I kept my eyes shut the whole time!
283938	They didn't look very nice.
285353	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>But they tasted alright?
286783	<strong>Neil</strong><br>They tasted okay, yes.
287978	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good.
288349	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Itâ€™s now time for a quiz. Which is correct?
294118	Number one: a) <strong>Iâ€™ve been for a job interview last week</strong> or b) <strong>I went for a job interview last week.
304385	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s b)<strong> I went for a job interview last week.</strong>
309409	Use the past simple when you say <strong>when </strong>something happened.
314017	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Number two: a) <strong>I never went for a job interview</strong> or b) <strong>I have never been for a job interview.
321268	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s b) <strong>I have never been for a job interview.</strong>
326003	We use the present perfect with <strong>never</strong><em>.
328278	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the last one: a) <strong>Who has eaten all my biscuits?
333486	</strong>or b) <strong>Who ate all my biscuits?
336877	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's a trick question because actually both are correct!
341381	And by the way, Neil, it wasnâ€™t me! I didnâ€™t eat all your biscuits.
344217	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, Iâ€™m sure. And that means we <strong>have</strong> now come to the end of our programme.
