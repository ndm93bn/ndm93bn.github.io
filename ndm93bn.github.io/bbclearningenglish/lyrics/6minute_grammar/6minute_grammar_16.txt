1	(Introduction...)
12005	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
15000	<strong>Finn <br></strong>And me, Finn. Hello.
16946	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>In this programme we're talking about present tenses.
20268	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Now let's get started. The first thing we need to know is that the present simple tense is mainly for facts, habits and truths.
28991	Now, Catherine, give me a true fact about you.
33393	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>A true fact about me is that I like gardening.
37540	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh, wow, great.
39107	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Love it.
39616	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thanks Catherine. And can you tell me one of your habits?
43401	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>I drink a cup of coffee every morning.
48162	I drink one at home and I drink another one when I get to work.
52101	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So far so good. We make the present simple with a subject and base verb, and we add <strong>-s</strong> to the verb for <strong>he</strong>, <strong>she</strong> and <strong>it</strong>.
62201	So: I work, you work, he works, she works, and so on.
67912	We make questions and negatives with <strong>do</strong> or <strong>does</strong>.
72360	So Catherine, do you take milk in your coffee?
76078	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>I do take milk in my coffee, Finn. Do you take milk in your coffee?
79083	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>I don't. I like it black.
81200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And what about Mrs Finn, does she take milk in her coffee?
84477	<strong>Finn<br></strong>She doesn't drink coffee.
85700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Oh, what does she drink?
86756	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Tea. All the time.
88552	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very British.
89503	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes.
90097	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Good. So that's present simple for facts and habits.
94300	Now when we're talking about activities, temporary situations, and things that are happening now â€“ or around now â€“ we use <strong>am</strong>, <strong>is</strong> or <strong>are </strong>plus an <strong>i-n-g verb</strong> to make the present continuous.
107353	So Finn, what are you doing now?
109583	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now, right now, right at this minute, I'm sitting in the studio, on a chair, talking to you, but off and on, I'm also reading a novel called The Unconsoled by Kazuo Ishiguro. It's great.
124200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well pronounced.
125056	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thank you. And are you reading anything right now Catherine?
128800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes I am. I'm reading a novel also.
131580	It's a comedy about Adrian Mole and it's really good, I'm enjoying it a lot.
136489	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Sounds great. I'd like to borrow it.
138100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You can. We can also use the present continuous for future arrangements.
142730	So Finn, what are you doing tonight?
144800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Tonight I'm taking my wife to dinner. Don't tell her.
149696	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Lucky wife.
151008	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. So, present simple for facts and habits; present continuous for activities and future arrangements.
158738	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And now for the present perfect.
160400	We make it with <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> plus the past participle, it connects the past to the present, and it's useful for asking about life experiences.
169707	So, life experience question coming, Finn. Have you ever eaten insects?
174855	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>I have, yes. I've eaten ants and beetles in Cambodia.
180581	So in the question, the word <strong>ever</strong> means 'at any time in your life'.
185422	<strong>Never</strong> means at no time in your life.
188623	So Catherine, tell us about an experience that you have <strong>never</strong> had.
194716	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, I've never eaten insects Finn. And I've never been on safari.
200504	But I'm sure that our colleague Rob has been on safari.
203804	<strong>Finn<br></strong>He's been to many places.
205123	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>He has. Other words we use with present perfect are <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong>.
211636	We use <strong>just</strong>, <strong>already</strong> and <strong>yet</strong> a lot when we're using the present perfect tense to talk about the present effect of a past event.
219832	<strong>Already</strong> means something has happened, perhaps earlier than expected.
224460	So Finn, give us an example of <strong>already</strong>:
227091	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. I've <strong>already</strong> had breakfast today.
230886	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And coffee? Have you had coffee?
232879	<strong>Finn <br></strong>I've <strong>just</strong> had a cup of coffee. <strong>Just</strong> means recently.
236923	I haven't had lunch <strong>yet</strong>.
239299	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I should think not, it's only half ten.
240902	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It's a bit early for lunch, yeah.
242200	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And <strong>yet</strong> means something like 'not until now'.
245305	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Good. And if a past situation has continued until now, use <strong>for</strong> or <strong>since</strong> to say how long it has continued, like this:
255929	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>I've lived in London <strong>for</strong> five years.
259861	I've been married <strong>since</strong> 2003.
263211	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We also use the present perfect is to give news.
266817	Things that happened a short time ago, and are important now.
271250	So, have you got any news for us, Catherine?
274213	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Yes I have, actually.
275477	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK?
276217	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I've won the lottery!
277466	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I don't believe you.
279550	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's because I'm not telling the truth, it's just an example!
282842	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.
289096	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And we're talking about present tenses. And it's quiz time!
292888	Question one. Which of these sentences best describes a habit?
296913	a) I have smoked 20 cigarettes a day, b) I smoke 20 cigarettes a day.
304900	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And the answer's b) I smoke 20 cigarettes a day.
309613	Question two. Is this sentence grammatically correct, or wrong?
314137	Humans have not visited the planet Mars yet, but they have already been to the moon.
320600	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>It's correct.
321788	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It is. Now, last one: Which sentence is correct?
325607	a) Catherine has never eaten insects, b) Catherine never eats insects, or c) Catherine is never eating insects.
336518	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is that both a) and b) are correct.
