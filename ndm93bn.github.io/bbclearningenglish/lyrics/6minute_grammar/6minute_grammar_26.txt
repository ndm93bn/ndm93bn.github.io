1	(Introduction...)
10222	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.
13333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, <strong>Catherine</strong>. Hello.
15034	<strong>Callum<br></strong>I was just admiring your hat Catherine.
17111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Oh, do you like it?
18100	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Well, it's interesting, <strong>really</strong> interesting. It's <strong>quite</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured, isn't it? And <strong>very</strong> shiny.
24122	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you, I think.
26643	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Anyway, moving on. In today's programme we're going to be looking at adverbs and we'll focus on how they are used with adjectives, other adverbs and also look at a couple of categories of adverbs and their usual positions.
41235	Catherine, could you remind us what adverbs do and why they are important?
46133	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Certainly Callum. Adverbs give us more information about <strong>verbs</strong>, <strong>adjectives</strong> and other <strong>adverbs</strong>.
53487	And they're important because they help us to answer questions such as where? When? How? And how often?
61900	And adverbs can add colour and depth to what we say and write. For example, listen to this sentence.
69100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>He picked up his coat and left. He picked up his coat and left.
76095	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, this is a perfectly good sentence, it's clear and grammatically correct. It tells us what happened but it's not very descriptive.
84760	Now listen again, only this time we're going to add some adverbs.
89704	<strong>Finn<br></strong>He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>.
95116	He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>.
100775	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, so the adverb <strong>calmly </strong>is very descriptive. It tells us how the person did the action.
108273	And there's an adverbial phrase as well, did you spot it? Listen again.
113257	<strong>Finn<br></strong>He <strong>calmly</strong> picked up his coat and left <strong>without making a sound</strong>.
118333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, did you spot the adverbial phrase?
121888	<strong>Callum<br></strong>It was 'without making a sound'.
124900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. So these adverbs give us lots of information which, depending on the context, can be very dramatic and atmospheric.
133777	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
139666	<strong>Callum<br></strong>This is 6 Minute Grammar and today we're taking a look at the position of adverbs. Catherine, I want to take you back to your hat.
147555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Really, must you?
148888	<strong>Callum<br></strong>I'm afraid I must, but it's all in the cause of education.
152299	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>OK then.
153222	<strong>Callum</strong><br>Can you remember how I described it?
155700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. If I remember rightly you said my hat was <strong>really</strong> interesting, <strong>quite</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured and <strong>very</strong> shiny.
164308	Aah, Callum, I see what you've done there. You've given examples of adverbs being used with adjectives and adverbs.
173777	<strong>Callum<br></strong>You see, I'm not just a pretty face.
176004	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Mmm. Anyway, when we use adverbs to describe adjectives or other adverbs, they must go <strong>before</strong> the adjective or adverb being modified.
186999	So, <strong>interesting</strong> is an adjective, and the adverb you used was <strong>really</strong>.
193111	The adverb goes before the adjective so the correct form is <strong>really interesting</strong>.
198451	And it's the same with the adjective<strong> shiny</strong>. You used the adverb <strong>very</strong>.
203503	So <strong>very shiny </strong>is correct.
206608	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And we also had an example of using an adverb to add information to another adverb, didn't we?
213333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We did Callum. You said my hat was <strong>very</strong> <strong>brightly</strong> coloured.
217222	Again the modifying adverb, in this case, <strong>very</strong>, must go before the adverb being described.
224008	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
229777	<strong>Callum<br></strong>I think we've got a little time to look at some different categories of adverbs.
234000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We have, so let's start with adverbs like <strong>always</strong>,<strong> never</strong>, <strong>often</strong>, <strong>regularly </strong>and<strong> hardly ever</strong>.
241888	We call these adverbs of indefinite frequency and these are <strong>frequently</strong> used â€“ oh, there's another one, <strong>frequently</strong>â€“ these are frequently used before the main verb.
253888	There are two in this example, <strong>never </strong>and <strong>always</strong>.
258854	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I have <strong>never</strong> met anyone like you. I think I will <strong>always</strong> love you.
264872	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now let's compare adverbs of indefinite frequency to adverbs of definite frequency, like <strong>this week</strong>, <strong>this year</strong>, <strong>daily</strong>.
275111	Listen out for the position of <strong>daily </strong>in this example.
278598	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I ride my bike <strong>daily</strong>.
281444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, these adverbs usually go in the third position, after the verb and object clause and not directly before the main verb.
290333	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Thanks Catherine. Now time for a short quiz to check some of today's points.
294800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We're going to give some example sentences.
297111	What are the adverbs and are they in the correct place? Here's the first one.
302999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>He plays tennis well very.
306333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The adverbs there are <strong>well </strong>and <strong>very</strong>.
309814	But the adverb <strong>very </strong>is in the wrong place. It should go before <strong>well</strong>.
314777	The correct sentence is: He plays tennis <strong>very well</strong>. Next example, please.
320888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It was a dark blue car that nearly hit me.
324902	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The adverb there is <strong>dark</strong> and it was in the correct place. Final sentence, please.
331333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I every day take the train to work.
335555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the adverb there, <strong>every day</strong>, is not in the correct place.
340500	It needs to go after the verb clause. So: I take the train to work <strong>every day</strong>.

353701	<strong>Both<br></strong>Goodbye.
355111	<strong>Callum<br></strong>One more question Catherine. Just why are you wearing a fluorescent purple cycle helmet in the studio?
360777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's a very good question.
