1	(Introduction...)
10200	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Neil.
13733	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And me, Catherine.
16283	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>Today we're talking about the present perfect continuous tense.
21158	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Weâ€™ll remind you when to use it and how to form itâ€¦
24650	<strong>Neil</strong> <br>Weâ€™ll also look at using it with the words <strong>just </strong>and <strong>already</strong> and other adverbs.
30115	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And weâ€™ll finish with a quiz.
33004	So letâ€™s kick things off with an example of the present perfect continuous, read for us by Finn.
39500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Iâ€™ve been reading that book you lent me last weekendâ€¦ itâ€™s great!
44994	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you Finn. So <strong>Iâ€™ve been readingâ€¦ </strong>is an action that started in the past and is continuing in the present: Finn is still reading that book.
55639	Hereâ€™s another example:
57554	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Itâ€™s been raining since 9 oâ€™clock this morning.
61527	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It has! It started raining in the morning, continued raining and itâ€™s still raining now.
68317	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We can also use the present perfect continuous for actions that have recently finished. An example, please Finn.
76057	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Iâ€™ve got paint all over my clothes because Iâ€™ve been decorating the living room.
81600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah, so Finn's got paint all over his clothes, and that's the evidence he was painting but now he's finished. Another example please, Finn:
91800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Joe! Where have you been?
94700	Iâ€™ve been trying to get hold of youâ€¦ Iâ€™ve got some bad news.
99831	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, Finn has finally managed to find Joe.
103900	The action of looking for Joe has finished but Finn was looking right up until the moment he found him.
111699	<strong>Neil<br></strong>To say how long an action has been happening for, we can add a time expression.
117535	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Jack has got a big concert tomorrow. Heâ€™s been rehearsing <strong>all day</strong>.
123335	Weâ€™ve been going to the same hotel<strong> for the last ten years</strong>.
128809	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Earlier, Finn said: it has been raining<strong> since 9 oâ€™clock this morning</strong>.
133400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>For three hours, for the last ten years </strong>and<strong> since 9 oâ€™clock this morning</strong> tell us how long the activity has been happening.
142900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The present perfect continuous is often used with the words <strong>already</strong> and <strong>just</strong>.
148003	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, we can use <strong>already </strong>if an action hasnâ€™t finished, and we want to emphasise how long itâ€™s been happening. Finn:
155926	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Sheâ€™s <strong>alread</strong>y been sleeping for three hours.
159957	This chicken has <strong>already</strong> been cooking for two hours.
164430	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We use <strong>just</strong> when the action has already finished - and we want to emphasise how recently it finished.
172111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thereâ€™s Yasemin â€“ Iâ€™ve <strong>just</strong> been talking to her husband on the phone!
176725	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We can also use <strong>recently </strong>or <strong>lately</strong> to say that a situation or action finished only a short while ago, but they are a little further back in time than <strong>just</strong>.
188138	So, Neil, have you been doing anything special recentlyâ€¦
191650	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, Iâ€™ve been trying to lose a bit of weight recently, so Iâ€™ve been going to the gym after work.
199400	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>It's starting to show a little bit.
200688	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. How about you, Catherineâ€¦?
202600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, Iâ€™m afraid I haven't been going to the gym because Iâ€™ve been feeling rather tired lately and I havenâ€™t been sleeping very well.
210888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Youâ€™ve been working too hard!
214010	Now, we form the present perfect continuous with the <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong> of the main verb.
222200	Here are some examples:
223707	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Jack has been working hard.
226621	Itâ€™s been raining â€¦
228489	Iâ€™ve been reading that book â€¦
231000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And for negatives, itâ€™s <strong>subject </strong>plus <strong>havenâ€™t</strong> or <strong>hasnâ€™t </strong>and the <strong>present participle</strong>.
237714	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I havenâ€™t been sleeping very well.
240950	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We usually put <strong>just </strong>and <strong>already</strong> between <strong>have</strong> or <strong>has</strong> and the <strong>past participle</strong>.
247600	So itâ€™s Sheâ€™s <strong>already</strong> been sleeping for three hours.
251669	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>â€¦</strong>and Iâ€™ve <strong>just</strong> been talking to her husband â€¦.
255127	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But time expressions usually go after the main verb.
259214	So itâ€™s Jackâ€™s been studying <strong>all day</strong>.
262940	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And donâ€™t forget to use short forms like <strong>Iâ€™veâ€¦ Itâ€™sâ€¦ havenâ€™tâ€¦ hasnâ€™t </strong>with the present perfect continuous.
272839	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.
276300	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And we're talking about the present perfect continuous.
279655	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We use it to talk about an activity that started in the past and is continuing now or has recently finished.
286600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we often use it with the adverbs <strong>just </strong>and<strong> already</strong>, and with other time expressions like <strong>recently</strong> and<strong> lately</strong>.
295176	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Time for our quiz.
297541	Number one. Which is correct?
300166	The chicken only needs another fifteen minutes.
305000	It's a) â€¦already been cooking for two hours, or b) Itâ€™s just been cooking for two hours.
312900	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And that's a) because the chicken is still cooking.
317166	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's correct. Number 2.
319798	a) Where have you been?
322311	I wait for you for half an hour.
324862	b) Where have you been?
327900	Iâ€™ve been waiting for you for half an hour.
330426	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Itâ€™s b) because you use the present perfect continuous to say how long you have been doing an action.
338344	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Finally, number 3.
340600	a) Youâ€™ve been listening just to 6 minute grammar.
345300	b) Youâ€™ve just been listening to 6 minute grammar.
349696	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Itâ€™s b) because <strong>just</strong> goes between the auxiliary <strong>have</strong> and <strong>been</strong>.
