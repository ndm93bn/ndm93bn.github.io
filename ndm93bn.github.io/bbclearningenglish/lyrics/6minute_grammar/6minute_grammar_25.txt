1	(Introduction...)
10111	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Callum.
13177	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
14666	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>In this programme, weâ€™re talking about relative clauses.
17900	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Yes, relative clauses add information about the person or thing that youâ€™re talking about.
24166	There are two kinds of relative clauses: defining and non-defining.
32555	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>Letâ€™s begin with defining relative clauses. Hereâ€™s Finn with an example:
37183	<strong>Finn <br></strong>The man <strong>whose phone I found</strong> gave me a reward.
41111	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>Thanks Finn. The clause <strong>whose phone I found</strong> is a defining relative clause because it identifies which man Finn is talking about.
51618	If I ask the question â€˜which manâ€™ â€“ the relative clause answers it: the man <strong>whose phone I found</strong>.
59000	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>That's right. And relative clauses usually start with a relative pronoun.
64499	We use <strong>who</strong> for people, <strong>which </strong>for things, <strong>that</strong> for both people and things and <strong>whose </strong>where a possessive is needed.
76444	Letâ€™s hear another defining relative clause:
79888	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Iâ€™ve lost the t-shirt <strong>that my mother gave me</strong>.
83799	<strong>Callum <br></strong>How careless of you Finn! Here, the relative clause <strong>that my mother gave me</strong> tells us which t-shirt Finn is talking about.
93279	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Iâ€™ve lost the t-shirt that my mother gave me.
97030	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Letâ€™s move on to non-defining relative clauses. Hereâ€™s an example:
102093	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Davidâ€™s mother, <strong>who was born in Mexico</strong>, is my sisterâ€™s Spanish teacher.
107666	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>OK. he phrase <strong>who was born in Mexico</strong> is a non-defining relative clause.
114555	It doesn't answer the question â€˜which mother?â€™ because David only has one mother!
120222	Instead, the relative clause gives us extra information about Davidâ€™s mother: she was born in Mexico.
128300	<strong>Callum <br></strong>In fact, if we leave the relative clause out entirely, the sentence still makes sense:
134666	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Davidâ€™s mother is my sisterâ€™s Spanish teacher.
138739	<strong>Callum <br></strong>Now letâ€™s look again at relative pronouns.
142177	We can use them to refer to the subject or object of a clause. Finn, who is Daniel Radcliffe?
150220	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Daniel Radcliffe is the actor <strong>who</strong> plays Harry Potter.
155100	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>In this sentence, the relative pronoun <strong>who</strong> refers to the subject â€“ Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter.
164071	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And another question for you Finn. Which sport do you enjoy the most?
169666	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Well, football is the sport <strong>that</strong> I enjoy the most, Catherine.
174016	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>This time, the pronoun <strong>that</strong> refers to the object.
178275	And you can usually leave out object pronouns, like this:
182124	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Football is the sport I enjoy the most.
185894	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>Youâ€™re listening to bbclearningenglish.com.
191563	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>For non-defining clauses, you canâ€™t leave out the pronoun.
195631	Also, non-defining relative clauses can't begin with the word <strong>that</strong>.
201726	Use <strong>which</strong> instead, like this:
204753	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Last year I went to Paris, <strong>which</strong> is the capital of France.
209599	<strong>Callum <br></strong>The clause <strong>which is the capital of France</strong> â€“ is giving us extra information.
214918	We can leave it out and still understand the sentence:
218090	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Last year I went to Paris.
220423	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now it's time for a quiz. Join these sentences together using a defining or non-defining relative clause.
228817	Number one. The bus was very late. I took it this morning.
233917	The bus was very late. I took it this morning.
239020	<strong>Callum<br></strong>The bus <strong>that</strong> I took this morning was very late.
243033	Or you could also say: The bus I took this morning was very late.
247499	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>You can, very good. Number two: My car needs repairing. I only bought it last month.
254169	My car needs repairing. I only bought it last month.
259900	<strong>Callum <br></strong>My car, <strong>which</strong> I only bought last month, needs repairing.
264333	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And that was a non-defining relative clause. Number three.
268585	David Beckham has over 20 tattoos. He used to play for Manchester United.
275333	David Beckham has over 20 tattoos. He used to play for Manchester United.
283000	<strong>Callum <br></strong>David Beckham, <strong>who</strong> used to play for Manchester United, has over 20 tattoos.
288535	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. And we could also say: David Beckham, <strong>who</strong> has over 20 tattoos, used to play for Manchester United.
296555	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz. Well done you got them all right. Now for a little tip.
302447	In written English, we put commas around non-defining relative clauses.
307610	In spoken English, we leave a small pause for each comma. Listen to this example:
313111	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>My sister, who works in Nairobi, is a doctor.
317735	<strong>Callum<br></strong>The pauses tell us that this is a non-defining relative clause, which means Finn has only one sister, so he doesnâ€™t need to define her.
327333	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>My uncle who works in Athens is a dentist.
330200	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And this time, thereâ€™s no pause, which means itâ€™s a defining relative clause.
335108	Finn is defining which uncle he is talking about, so he probably has more than one uncle.
341600	<strong>Callum <br></strong>Thanks Finn. So thatâ€™s defining and non-defining relative clauses.
346927	They start with a relative pronoun and give additional information about the person or thing that youâ€™re talking about.
354000	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Thereâ€™s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
