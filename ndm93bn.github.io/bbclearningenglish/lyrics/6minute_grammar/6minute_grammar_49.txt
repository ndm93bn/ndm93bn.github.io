1	(Introduction...)
11872	<strong>Finn</strong><strong> </strong><strong> <br></strong>Hello again. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
15330	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
16851	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>In this programme we're talking about the past with <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>would</strong>.
23059	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, so let's get started.
25571	Finn, can you tell us, please, something interesting that <strong>you</strong> <strong>used to do</strong> when you were a child.
32712	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Right, OK, well. <strong>I used to sleepwalk</strong>.
37636	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Sleepwalk? Every night Finn?
40127	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Yes<strong>, I used to wake up</strong> every night at around midnight.
44870	And <strong>I would get out of</strong> bed.
47000	Sometimes <strong>I would </strong>even<strong> get dressed!</strong>And then I would sleepwalk.
53058	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Your poor mum and dad!
54428	So Finn said <strong>he used to wake up </strong>and <strong>he would get out of</strong> bed.
60113	And we use <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>would</strong> to talk about thingsthat happened regularly in the past, usually when we're comparing the past with the present.
69586	Hereâ€™s Neil with those examples again:
72493	<strong>Neil</strong> <br><strong>I used to sleepwalk</strong>.
74699	<strong>I used to wake up</strong> every night at midnight.
78857	<strong>I would get</strong> <strong>out of</strong> bed.
82048	Sometimes <strong>I would</strong> even<strong> get dressed.
86098	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Very good, thank you Neil.
88272	Usually either <strong>used to</strong> or <strong>would</strong> is possible.
92444	So I can say I <strong>used to</strong> get out of bed or I <strong>would</strong> get out of bed.
98816	Let's hear some more examples:
101045	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>I used to get</strong> the bus to work but now I walk. It's quicker.
107082	<strong>The bus used to take</strong> half an hour.
111894	<strong>My girlfriend would meet</strong> me at the bus stop.
116264	Then <strong>we would go</strong> for a quick drink.
118837	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Now, we follow <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>would</strong> with an infinitive without to for all persons, so it's: <strong>I used to get, the bus used to take, My girlfriend would meet me, we would go.
133922	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we often use the contracted, or short, form of <strong>would</strong>, so instead of <strong>We would go </strong>for a drink, I can say <strong>we'd go</strong> for a drink, <strong>I'd </strong>get dressed, and so on.
147310	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But thereâ€™s no contraction for <strong>used to.
150497	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So that's <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>would</strong> for repeated actions or habits in the past.
157127	Now we can also use <strong>used to</strong> to talk about a continued state, or situation in the past. Neil.
164770	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Zina used to live</strong> in Taiwan, but now she's living in the UK.
169435	<strong>I used to love</strong> cooking, but I don't have much time now.
174488	<strong>There used to be</strong> a restaurant here but they knocked it down.
178941	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now we don't use <strong>would</strong> in this way, so you can't say: <strong>There would be</strong> a restaurant here but they knocked it down.
187078	<strong>Would</strong> is for things that happened regularly.
190236	We can't use it to talk about past states or situations.
195830	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com
201740	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're looking at <strong>used to</strong> and <strong>would</strong> to talk about what happened regularly in the past.
207703	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...and also to talk about some of Finn's strange night-time habits.
212155	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Come on. I was a kid! I don't do any of this anymore.
216640	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Are you sure?
217449	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Nothing like this. Only worse things. What about you Catherine?
221370	<strong>Did you use to do</strong> anything strange when you were younger?
224321	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, not as strange as sleepwalking, <strong>I didn't use to</strong> <strong>sleepwalk</strong>.
228451	But at night <strong>I would sleep</strong> on the floor from time to time.
231485	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Really?! <strong>Didn't you use to sleep</strong> in your bed?
235285	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>No, <strong>I would get into</strong> bed, but <strong>I wouldn't stay</strong> there.
238134	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Interesting! Right, OK, for questions and negatives with used to - we use <strong>did</strong> or <strong>didn't</strong> plus <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>use to</strong> plus <strong>infinitive</strong>.
251005	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...so Finn asked me: "<strong>Did you use to do</strong> anything strange?"
256010	And he asked me: "<strong>Didn't you use to sleep</strong> in your bed?"
260287	<strong>Finn<br></strong>...and Catherine replied: "<strong>I didn't use to sleepwalk</strong>."
264237	That's <strong>subject</strong> plus <strong>didn't</strong> plus <strong>use to</strong> plus <strong>infinitive</strong>.
268971	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...and that's <strong>use to</strong> written without a <strong>-d</strong>.
272354	In positive sentences <strong>used to</strong> has a -<strong>d</strong> at the end.
277802	But in negative sentences and questions, we write <strong>use </strong>without a -<strong>d</strong>.
283364	<strong>Finn<br></strong>...Now, the negative of <strong>would</strong> is <strong>wouldn't</strong>, so Catherine said <strong>I wouldn't stay</strong> there.
290191	We use <strong>wouldn't</strong> in questions, too.
293327	So Catherine, <strong>wouldn't you go</strong> back to bed?
296155	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>No, <strong>my parents used to put</strong> me back to bed.
301211	<strong>Finn</strong><br>OK, time for a quiz. Number one. Listen to this sentence.
307606	Is <strong>used to</strong> spelt with, or without, a <strong>-d</strong>?
312730	When I lived in Jordan, <strong>I used to go</strong> to the beach every day.
317845	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's <strong>used to</strong> with a <strong>â€“d</strong>.
320523	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Good, now number two. Is this sentence right or wrong?
324415	<strong>Suleyman would have</strong> blond hair when he was a baby.
328476	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's wrong. The correct sentence is <strong>Suleyman used to have</strong> blond hair when he was a baby.
334254	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Correct. Number three. Is this right or wrong?
337360	<strong>Do you used to live</strong> in Beijing?
340167	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's wrong. <strong>Use to</strong> questions need <strong>did</strong>, not <strong>do</strong>.
345257	And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.
348519	<strong>Finn<br></strong>There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
352852	Join us again soon for 6 Minute Grammar.
355568	<strong>Both</strong> <br>Bye.
