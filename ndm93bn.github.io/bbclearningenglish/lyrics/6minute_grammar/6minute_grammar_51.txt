11100	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, <strong>Callum</strong>.
14555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, <strong>Catherine</strong>. Hello.
17000	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>In this programme weâ€™re talking about adverbs and where they should go. Catherine, remind us what adverbs are.
25505	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Certainly Callum. Adverbs are words or phrases that we use to give more information about verbs, adjectives or other adverbs.
34426	We use them to express how someone does something or how something happens.
39616	<strong>Callum<br></strong>In todayâ€™s programme weâ€™re going to focus on how they are used with verbs.
44343	Listen out for the adverbs <strong>usually</strong>, <strong>really</strong>, <strong>hardly</strong> and <strong>ever</strong>. Hereâ€™s Finn.
51888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work. I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work.
57701	I donâ€™t <strong>really</strong> like cheese. I donâ€™t <strong>really</strong> like cheese.
63666	I can <strong>hardly</strong> believe what happened at the concert.
67146	I can <strong>hardly</strong> believe what happened at the concert.
71239	Have you <strong>ever</strong> been to Scotland?
73920	Have you <strong>ever</strong> been to Scotland?
78340	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Now, letâ€™s look more closely at where to put the adverb.
82654	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Adverbs can usually be placed in one of three positions.
86888	<strong>Callum<br></strong>The first position is at the very beginning of the sentence, before the subject.
91616	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Usually</strong> I drive to work.
94100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The second position is before the main verb.
97800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I <strong>usually</strong> drive to work.
100086	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And the third position is after the direct object or complement of the verb.
104700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I drive to work <strong>usually</strong>.
107555	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>Youâ€™re listening to BBC Learning English.
112100	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Today weâ€™re talking about where to put adverbs when we are using them to give more information about verbs.
118372	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Weâ€™ve seen that there are three positions where adverbs typically go.
122813	<strong>Callum<br></strong>So is it the case that you can put any adverb in any of these positions?
126977	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Callum, if it was that simple, it would be fantastic.
130555	Many adverbs can indeed go in any of these positions, depending on style and context.
136400	<strong>Callum<br></strong>I feel there is a 'butâ€™ coming.
138200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Butâ€¦
139000	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Ah, there it isâ€¦
139600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But thatâ€™s not always the case.
142589	Some adverbs canâ€™t go in certain places and some are more common in particular positions than others.
149455	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And we also have to consider modals and other auxiliaries, questions and negatives.
154444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We do. So letâ€™s start with the verb <strong>to be</strong><em>.
157666	When the verb <strong>to be </strong>is the main verb of a sentence, we usually put adverbs immediately after the verb.
165602	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Heâ€™s <strong>always</strong> on time. I was <strong>never</strong> happy at school.
170921	<strong>Callum<br></strong>When there is more than one part to the verb, where does the adverb go?
174800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>If there is an auxiliary such as have or has in the present perfect or a modal like can, will, should and so on, the adverb usually goes after the auxiliary and before the main verb.
190061	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You can <strong>never</strong> predict what mood he is going to be in.
194000	Iâ€™ve <strong>rarely</strong> seen him angry. I will <strong>always</strong> love you.
200200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'll always love you Finn. The same is true in negative sentences.
206197	The adverb will come after the negative and before the main verb.
210999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Iâ€™ve <strong>never</strong> visited Iceland. Iâ€™ve <strong>never</strong> visited Iceland.
216156	He canâ€™t <strong>even</strong> make a cup of tea. He canâ€™t <strong>even</strong> make a cup of tea.
221777	<strong>Callum<br></strong>What about questions?
223111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The same is true there. The adverb comes after the question word or auxiliary and before the main verb.
230333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Do you <strong>still</strong> live in the same city? Do you <strong>still</strong> live in the same city?
236111	Would you <strong>really</strong> like me to come and stay?
239207	Would you <strong>really</strong> like me to come and stay?
241777	Have you <strong>ever</strong> thought about emigrating?
244178	Have you <strong>ever</strong> thought about emigrating?
247888	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Now, are there any places where you can't put an adverb?
252222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>There are. Adverbs donâ€™t go between a main verb and its direct object.
257555	So for example could I say: I play very well tennis?
262222	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Well you could say it, but it wouldnâ€™t be right.
264222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK then, how about this? I play tennis very well.
267500	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Thatâ€™s correct, though only grammatically.
269987	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>What do you mean?
270900	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Well actually you play tennis awfully!
273100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's true actually Callum, yep.
281222	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Weâ€™re nearly at the end of todayâ€™s programme, just time to take our quick quiz on this topic.
286056	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Youâ€™re going to hear some sentences and you need to decide if the adverbs are in the correct place. Hereâ€™s the first one
292777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You always must remember to lock the door when you leave. You always must remember to lock the door when you leave.
302604	<strong>Callum<br></strong>This one isâ€¦.not right.
305666	The adverb <strong><em>always</em></strong> should come after the modal â€˜mustâ€™ and before the main verb â€˜rememberâ€™.
312666	Hereâ€™s the next one.
313999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I have never learned a foreign language. I have never learned a foreign language.
320999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>This isâ€¦ correct.
323589	The adverb, in this case <strong>never</strong> comes between the auxiliary â€˜haveâ€™ and the main verb â€˜learnedâ€™.
330352	And the final sentence.
332122	<strong>Finn<br></strong>She rarely is late.
337857	<strong>Callum<br></strong>This isâ€¦ not correct. The adverb <strong>rarely </strong>should come after the verb â€˜to beâ€™.
344327	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So thatâ€™s our introduction to the position of adverbs.
