1	(Introduction...)
10629	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.
14202	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And me, Sophie. Hello.
16149	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Today we're talking about comparatives and superlatives â€“ what they are and how to use them.
21798	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes, we use comparatives and superlatives to compare people and things.
27021	Listen carefully because, as usual, there is a quiz at the end of the show.
31136	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, we'll start with some examples of the comparative.
34787	So, Sophie, can you stand up, please.
37550	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>OKâ€¦
38514	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Right, look, back to back here. I'm taller than you.
45657	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>But I'm thinner than you!
48070	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Good point. The sentences I'm taller than you and I'm thinner than you both use the comparative form.
54245	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>We use comparatives to compare two people or things that are different in some way.
59467	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Listen again to the examples we've just used: where does the word than come?
64524	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I'm taller than you. I'm thinner than you.
69247	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Than comes after the comparative adjective.
73555	We usually use than in comparative sentences.
76818	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But not always, for example, I can ask: Who is taller â€“ you or me?
83037	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Now, there are different ways to make the comparative form: For short words, just add 'er'.
89840	That's spelled e â€“ r. So tall becomes taller â€¦
94791	<strong>Rob<br></strong>â€¦thin becomes thinner â€¦
97281	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Adjectives like happy, funny, easyâ€¦ that end in the sound /i/ [phonemic sound 'y'], spelled with a 'y', add 'ier', spelled: i â€“ e â€“ r.
109600	<strong>Rob<br></strong>â€¦so happy becomes happierâ€¦
113162	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>...easy becomes easier. An example, please Neil.
116811	<strong>Neil<br></strong>English is easier than Chinese.
121002	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Not if you're Chinese, though!
123296	Now, adjectives that have two or more syllables but don't end in /i/ (spelled 'y'), use 'more'.
130503	Neil has some examples.
132357	<strong>Neil<br></strong>A tablet is more useful than a laptop.
135787	The film of 'The Hobbit' is more exciting than the book.
141176	<strong>Rob<br></strong>'Useful' has two syllables and 'exciting' has three, so we say more useful and more exciting.
154069	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And we're talking about comparatives and superlatives.
157719	We've seen how to use and make comparativesâ€¦
160475	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now we're going to tell you what superlatives are and how to use them.
164624	Sophie, are you good at geography?
167284	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I'll have a go.
168702	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Here's a question for you: What's the longest river in the world?
173069	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, the Nile is a very long river, but I think that the longest river in the world is the Amazon.
180195	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Andâ€¦ you're right! It is the Amazon.
182819	'The longest river' is a superlative.
185625	We use superlative forms to compare one person or thing with several others in a group.
191366	We often use them to say which thing or person is the greatest, the biggestâ€¦
195876	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦the most beautiful, the bestâ€¦ in some way.
198961	<strong>Rob<br></strong>To make the superlative of short words like high, deep, tall, add 'est'.
204828	That's spelled e-s-t.
206111	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>So, the highest mountain, the deepest ocean, the tallest personâ€¦
211908	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And remember to put 'the' before the adjective.
215595	So it's: I'm the tallest person in my family.
219283	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Now for longer adjectives, with two or more syllables, we use most.
224920	Rob, who is the most famous actor in the world?
228512	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, there are many, aren't there, but I think Brad Pitt is the most famous actor in the world.
233732	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦'the most famous actor'. So it's the + most + adjective.
239826	<strong>Rob<br></strong>For adjectives that end in /i/ â€“ spelled 'y' â€“ like funny, and happy, we add 'iest' â€“ that's i-e-s-t.
249303	Here's an example.
250933	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The funniest show on TV is 'The Simpsons'.
254793	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Now, finally, look out for the irregular comparatives and superlatives.
260694	<strong>Neil<br></strong>My iPhone 5 was better than my iPhone 4, but the iPhone 6 is the best phone on the market now, in my opinion.
270828	<strong>Rob<br></strong>The comparative form of good is better and the superlative form is best.
277073	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>The comparative of bad is worse.
279996	<strong>Rob<br></strong>â€¦and the superlative is worst. Listen to these examples:
283513	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Winters have been bad the last few years.
287806	2012 was worse than 2011, but 2013 was the worst winter since records began.
295791	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Now for the quiz.
297973	I'll give you an adjective and a sentence and you have to complete the gap with a comparative or superlative.
304621	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. Number 1: the word is 'old'.
307742	Jenny is ten and Simon is fifteen, so Simon is ______ than Jenny.
314065	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the answer is: older. Simon is older than Jenny.
319296	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Next word: 'beautiful'. The Taj Mahal is the ___________ building I've ever seen.
326983	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the answer is: most beautiful.
330628	The Taj Mahal is the most beautiful building I've ever seen.
334697	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Final word: 'good'. Using BBC Learning English is the _____ way to improve your English.
342894	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Best. Using BBC Learning English is the best way to improve your English.
