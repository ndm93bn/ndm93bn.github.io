16515	<strong>Rob</strong><strong> </strong><strong> <br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Rob.
19961	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
21566	This programme is all about the second conditional.
25177	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes the second conditional. Weâ€™ll see how to form itâ€¦
29002	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Weâ€™ll look at why and when we use itâ€¦<strong> </strong>
31672	<strong>Rob <br></strong>Thereâ€™ll be a very helpful pronunciation tipâ€¦
34076	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And thereâ€™ll be a second conditional quiz at the end of the show, so listen carefully!
40232	<strong>Rob <br></strong>Letâ€™s start by looking at why and when we use the second conditional.
45106	The main use of the second conditional is to talk about impossible, unlikely or imaginary situations.
52220	And hereâ€™s an example to do with football. Catherine, are you a football fan?
56581	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Errâ€¦ I like to watch the big games, the internationals, the England games in particular â€“ I do like an England game.
63187	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, they havenâ€™t won for a long timeâ€¦
65875	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Not since â€™66, I thinkâ€¦
67628	<strong>Rob<br></strong>â€™66 was a long time ago, but maybe theyâ€™ll win one dayâ€¦
71135	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Maybe!
71554	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But at the moment itâ€™s just a dream; not a strong possibility.
75067	So Mikeâ€™s here: letâ€™s have a second conditional sentence about that situation Mike:
80198	<strong>Mike <br></strong>If England won the World Cup, Catherine would be so happy.
85023	<strong>Rob <br></strong>If England won the World Cup, Catherine would be so happy. Catherine, is that true?
91154	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>It is, actually, Iâ€™d be very happy. Unlikely, but, Iâ€™d be happy.
95736	So: this is a second conditional sentence and it is made of two parts.
100586	The first part starts with the word <strong>if, </strong>plus<strong> a subject </strong>and<strong> a past simple verb</strong>, and it describes an unlikely or imaginary situation, like this:
112853	<strong>Mike <br></strong>If England won the World Cupâ€¦
115549	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Thanks Mike. And the second part of the sentence has the word <strong>would</strong> or the negative <strong>woudnâ€™t</strong> with <strong>an infinitive</strong> <strong>verb</strong>.
123732	It describes a possible result of the unlikely or imaginary situation.
129545	<strong>Mike <br></strong>â€¦Catherine would be so happy.
132211	<strong>Rob <br></strong>Thatâ€™s the result of the imaginary situation.
136266	And yes, If England won the World Cup, we would be very happy, wouldnâ€™t we, Catherine?
140490	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>We would!
141301	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Good. Now, we can change the order of the two parts, and the meaning stays the same:
146540	<strong>Mike <br></strong>Weâ€™d be so happy if England won the World Cup.
150360	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Right, thanks Mike. Letâ€™s have some more examples.
153567	<strong>Mike<br></strong>If Sunny had more money, heâ€™d get a better phone.
159024	I wouldnâ€™t see you very often if I lived in the city.
162431	Maria would have a better job if she spoke more English.
167295	If I were you, Iâ€™d take a holiday.
172412	<strong>Rob <br></strong>Thanks: lots of examples there.
174993	And the last one is particularly interesting: <strong>If I were you, Iâ€™d take a holiday</strong>.
180650	And of course this isnâ€™t a real situation, because I canâ€™t be you, can I?
185681	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>You canâ€™t be anybody Rob, except yourself, just you: weâ€™re stuck with you.
190195	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Youâ€™re stuck with me, yes: Iâ€™m afraid so.
192189	Anyway, we say a second conditional sentence starting with the words <strong>If I were you</strong> when we want to give someone some advice.
200477	And here the advice is to go on holiday.
204241	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Itâ€™s interesting that a lot of native speakers say <strong>If I were you</strong>, not if <strong>I was you</strong>.
211768	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>And if I were you, Iâ€™d go somewhere nice and hot with palm trees and sandy beaches. Mmm.
218774	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>6 Minute Grammar, from BBC Learning English.
223740	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>And weâ€™re talking about second conditionals.
226630	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Now for a word about pronunciation.
229052	Contractions or short forms â€“ are very common in second conditionals â€“ but they can sometimes be difficult to hear.
238380	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Yes, thatâ€™s a good point.
239758	In the last example, the two words <strong>I</strong> and <strong>would</strong> become <strong>Iâ€™d</strong>.
245271	<strong>Iâ€™d </strong>take a holiday.
246478	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>So <strong>would</strong> is shortened to just a <strong>/d/ </strong>sound.
252088	Listen out for the short <strong>/d/</strong> sound in this next example:
256670	<strong>Mike <br></strong>If I knew the answer, <strong>Iâ€™d </strong>tell you.
259740	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Yes, the phrase <strong>I would tell</strong> becomes <strong>Iâ€™d tell</strong>.
264961	One more time please Mike:
266085	<strong>Mike <br></strong>If I knew the answer, <strong>Iâ€™d tell</strong> you.
270530	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>Well, wherever you are, I hope you know the answers to the quiz. Itâ€™s coming up next!
275601	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Yes, itâ€™s quiz time!
276912	Choose the correct word or phrase to fill each gap. Hereâ€™s the first one.
281857	If you [beep] some money on the street, what would you do?
286020	Is the missing word a) find b) found or c) would find?
293824	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>And the answer is b): If you <strong>found</strong> Â£50 on the street, what would you do?
300427	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Another one: If you forgot your wifeâ€™s birthday what [beep] she do?
306784	Is it a) does, b) will or c) would?
312259	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>So the answer is c): If you forgot your wifeâ€™s birthday what <strong>would</strong> she do?
319706	I wonder what sheâ€™d doâ€¦
321156	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And the last one: I wouldnâ€™t eat that if I [beep] you.
326056	Is it a) am b) were or c) be?
330946	<strong>Rob <br></strong>And its b): I wouldnâ€™t eat that if I <strong>were</strong> you.
336516	Well done if you got all those right.
339141	So weâ€™ve been talking about the second conditional.
343212	Itâ€™s made of <strong>if</strong> plus <strong>the past simple</strong> tense, and <strong>would</strong> plus <strong>the</strong> <strong>infinitive</strong>.
349662	We use it to talk about imaginary situations and their results.
354124	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Thereâ€™s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
