1	(Introduction...)
12211	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Catherineâ€¦
15717	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And me, Neil. Hello.
20083	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>In this programme weâ€™re talking about modal verbs of ability.
24098	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, we are. Weâ€™ll explain what they areâ€¦
26511	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Weâ€™ll give you some useful tips on using themâ€¦
28962	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thereâ€™ll be lots examplesâ€¦
30713	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And of course weâ€™ll finish with a quiz.
35020	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So here we go. First of all, what are modals of ability?
40466	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, there are lots of different modal verbs like <strong>must, might </strong>and <strong>have to</strong>.
45413	And we use them together with main verbs, to add meaning to what we say.
50256	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So in this programme weâ€™re talking about the modal verbs <strong>can </strong>and<strong> could.
55484	Weâ€™re looking at how we can use these modals with main verbs to add meaning related to ability.
62389	Hereâ€™s Mike with an example.
64785	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Humans <strong>can </strong>only<strong> live</strong> without water for three to five days.
70330	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So thatâ€™s <strong>can</strong> with the verb live to express ability.
74595	And in this example, the ability to live without water.
79071	And in this programme weâ€™re also going to talk about ability with the phrase <strong>be able to</strong> plus a verb.
85770	Itâ€™s similar to <strong>can</strong>, but itâ€™s particularly useful when weâ€™re suggesting that something is a bit surprising like this from Mike.
93938	<strong>Mike<br></strong>Humans <strong>can </strong>only<strong> live</strong> without water for three to five days.
98140	However, they <strong>are able to live</strong> without food for up to three weeks.
103916	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Okay. In those examples weâ€™re talking about ability in the present. Now for the past.
110614	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, the past. And the past of <strong>can</strong> is <strong>could</strong>.
113828	We also use <strong>be able to </strong>in the past but of course it becomes <strong>was able to</strong> or <strong>were able to</strong>. Listen.
122783	<strong>Mike<br></strong>People in Asia <strong>could write</strong> before people in Europe.
127791	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Orâ€¦
128471	<strong>Mike<br></strong>People in Asia <strong>were able to write</strong> before people in Europe.
132797	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But sometimes you have to use <strong>be able to</strong> and not <strong>could</strong>.
137308	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that happens when weâ€™re talking about a single event in the past, not general ability.
143685	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. Another example please, Mike.
146126	<strong>Mike<br></strong>After climbing for six hours, they <strong>were able to reach </strong>the top of the mountain.
151429	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You canâ€™t use <strong>could</strong> in that example because <strong>could </strong>is for general ability, not a single occasion like climbing one mountain.
161322	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But there is another verb that you can use in that last sentence. Have a listen.
166958	<strong>Mike<br></strong>After climbing for six hours, they <strong>managed to reach </strong>the top of the mountain.
172093	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thank you Mike.
172924	We often use <strong>manage to </strong>with a verb for ability if something is very difficult to do or if something is very successful.
182029	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Remember that <strong>can</strong> and <strong>could </strong>are always followed by the infinitive without <strong>to</strong>.
188843	And they are the same for all subject pronouns.
191831	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Right. But <strong>be able to</strong> changes for different persons.
196475	Itâ€™s <strong>am/is/are able to</strong> for the present and <strong>was/were able to</strong> for the past.

210941	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And weâ€™re looking at modal verbs of ability.
214117	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, we are. And weâ€™ve got a few extra tips for you today.
217518	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We have. And the first tip is, you know sense verbs like <strong>see, hear</strong> and <strong>smell</strong>?
223869	And verbs of thinking like <strong>believe, understand</strong> and <strong>remember</strong>?
228630	Well, we usually use <strong>can</strong> and not <strong>be able to</strong> with those.
234032	Examples please, Mike.
235389	<strong>Mike<br></strong>I <strong>canâ€™t understand</strong> this question.
237973	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. Second tip.
240042	When we have two main verbs together, we canâ€™t put <strong>can</strong> or <strong>could</strong> between them.
246698	For example, with the sentence Iâ€™d like to swim. Itâ€™s okay to sayâ€¦
252133	<strong>Mike<br></strong><strong>Iâ€™d like to be able to swim.
254432	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But itâ€™s not okay to sayâ€¦
256620	<strong>Mike<br></strong><strong>Iâ€™d like to can swim</strong>.
258752	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh no, you canâ€™t say that! It sounds a bit strange.
262048	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, horrible.
262813	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Next tip: There is also no present perfect form of <strong>can</strong>.
266877	If we need the present perfect for ability, we use <strong>be able to</strong>. An example, please?
273126	<strong>Mike<br></strong>He <strong>hasnâ€™t been able to walk</strong> since the accident.
276770	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you, Mike. And now a tip about <strong>manage to</strong> in the negative form.
281571	We say <strong>canâ€™t manage to</strong> in the present, but itâ€™s <strong>couldnâ€™t manage to </strong>or<strong> didnâ€™t manage to</strong> in the past.
289117	<strong>Mike<br></strong>I <strong>canâ€™t manage to swim</strong> that far! Fifty-five pies?!
295583	I <strong>canâ€™t manage to eat</strong> all those.
297807	The men <strong>couldnâ€™t</strong> <strong>manage to lift</strong> the piano.
301861	He <strong>didnâ€™t</strong> <strong>manage to get </strong>the grades he needed for university.
306247	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Okay, thank you, Mike. And now - itâ€™s quiz time.
310480	Will you manage to get three correct answers?
313440	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Letâ€™s see. Are these sentences correct or incorrect?
318008	Number one: The villagers were good hunters, but they <strong>couldnâ€™t grow</strong> crops.
325056	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And thatâ€™s correct.
326443	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well done! Number two: My phone wasnâ€™t working but the receptionist <strong>could phone </strong>for a taxi.
334926	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And thatâ€™s not correct.
336955	The correct sentence is <strong>the receptionist was able to phone for a taxi.
343031	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And number three: I <strong>want to can do </strong>this.
347110	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And thatâ€™s not correct. Between two main verbs, we have to use <strong>be able to</strong>.
352565	So the correct sentence is <strong>I want to be able to do this</strong>.
357114	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that is the end of the quiz.
358999	Congratulations if you <strong>managed to get</strong> them all right!
361778	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. Well done!
