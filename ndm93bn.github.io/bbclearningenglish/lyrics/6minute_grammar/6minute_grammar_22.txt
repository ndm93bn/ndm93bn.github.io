12082	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
16399	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
18666	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Today we're talking about comparatives and superlatives. So, let's start with comparatives.
27239	We use them to compare one thing or person with another. Catherine, how was your journey to work this morning?
35800	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Ok. Well, my journey to work wasn't great, actually. I woke up later than usual, so I took the bus because it's quicker than walking.
44118	And it's easier than cycling, too. But the traffic was much busier than normal and we went slower and slower and people became more and more impatient.
55455	And the slower the bus went, the more impatient the people became.
59900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You poor thing. But, lots of comparatives there in your story - we had <strong>later</strong> and <strong>quicker</strong>: Catherine woke up <strong>later</strong> than usual, and she said the bus is <strong>quicker</strong> than walking.
74500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I did. And to make the comparative form of short adjectives or adverbs, we just add the letters <strong>-</strong><strong>e-r</strong>.
82875	So, <strong>quick</strong>, <strong>quicker</strong>.
85128	But if the word already ends in <strong>-e</strong>, we just add the letter <strong>-r</strong>. <strong>Late</strong>, <strong>later</strong>.
92046	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Remember that we often use the word <strong>than</strong> in comparative sentences, but sometimes we can leave it out, for example in the question <strong>Which is quicker â€“ the bus or the train?
104800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I also said that the bus is <strong>easier than cycling</strong> and <strong>the traffic was much busier than normal</strong>.
111955	For adjectives and adverbs that end in the letter <strong>-y</strong> and the sound <strong>ee</strong>, make comparatives by losing the letter <strong>-y</strong> and adding the letters <strong>-i-e-r</strong>.
123103	So the comparative of <strong>easy </strong>is <strong>easier</strong>.
126745	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And <strong>busy</strong> becomes <strong>busier</strong>. In fact, Catherine said the traffic was <strong>much</strong> busier.
134724	Now, we can use <strong>much</strong> or <strong>a lot</strong> before an adjective or adverb to emphasise the difference. <strong>Much busier; a lot easier</strong>.
144643	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>To make comparative forms of most adjectives and adverbs with two or more syllables, we use <strong>more</strong>.
152245	<strong>Finn<br></strong>For example,<strong> impatient</strong> has three syllables: <strong>im-pa-tient</strong>, so the comparative of <strong>impatient</strong> is <strong>more impatient</strong>.
163005	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right and to emphasise how something changes, we can repeat comparatives, or the word <strong>more</strong> with <strong>and</strong> in the middle, like this:
173057	<strong>Finn</strong><br>The bus went<strong> slower and slower </strong>and people became<strong> more and more impatient</strong>.
179555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Don't remind me. Hereâ€™s another way to use comparatives.
184000	Listen to this sentence: <strong>the slower the bus went, the more impatient the people became</strong>.
190666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I'm not surprised. Here Catherine used two different comparatives - <strong>slower</strong> and <strong>more impatient</strong> - with <strong>the</strong>, to say how one thing changes when something else changes.
203800	<strong>The slower the bus went</strong>, <strong>the more impatient the people became</strong>. Really not a good morning, was it, Catherine?
212400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Not at all. And it got <strong>worse</strong> when the bus broke down!
216205	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh really? Oh no, but perfect for us because<strong> worse</strong> is the comparative adjective of bad.
224968	It is irregular. The comparative adverb is <strong>badly</strong>. Catherineâ€™s morning went <strong>badly</strong>.
231544	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very badly. And the comparative of both <strong>good</strong> and <strong>well</strong> is also irregular: it's <strong>better</strong>.
238577	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from the BBC.
244800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about comparatives and superlatives.
248199	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Let's look at superlative adjectives and adverbs. They help us compare one person or thing with <strong>several</strong> others.
257104	So Catherine, what is <strong>the quickest</strong> way for you to get to work?
261326	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, usually the bus is <strong>the quickest</strong>, but not today.
265012	But walking is <strong>the most reliable</strong> way and itâ€™s also <strong>the easiest</strong>.
269900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK, we make superlatives in a similar way to comparativesâ€¦
274222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ but the ending for short words is <strong>-e-s-t</strong>.
277674	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So <strong>quick</strong> becomes <strong>the</strong> <strong>quickest</strong>â€¦
280304	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ and we use <strong>most</strong> for words with two or more syllables.
283970	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So the superlative of <strong>reliable</strong> is <strong>the</strong> <strong>most reliable</strong>.
288792	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. For two-syllable words ending in the letter <strong>-y,</strong> change the <strong>y</strong> to<strong> i</strong> and add <strong>-e-s-t</strong>, so <strong>easy</strong> becomes <strong>the easiest</strong>.
300154	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Don't forget to put <strong>the</strong> before a superlative adjective or adverb, so it's: walking is <strong>the best</strong> way to get to workâ€¦
310000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ though we can use possessive adjectives instead of the word <strong>the</strong>, like this:
315174	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>My best</strong> friend is getting married today.
318000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And did you spot the irregular superlative - <strong>best</strong>?
321744	This is the superlative form of <strong>good </strong>and<strong> well</strong>.
325325	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ and the irregular superlative of <strong>bad</strong> is <strong>worst</strong>.
330444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now for the quiz. Which is correct?
333068	a) Your internet connection is faster than mine or b) Your internet connection is fastest than mine.
341960	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It's a).
343800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. And the last one, a) I hope I have a better journey home tonight or b) I hope I have a best journey home tonight.
352800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, itâ€™s a). And we do hope you have a much better journey home tonight, Catherine.
358900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you.
