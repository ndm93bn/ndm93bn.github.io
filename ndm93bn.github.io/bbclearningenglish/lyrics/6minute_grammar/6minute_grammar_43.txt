1	(Introduction...)
11549	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
15416	<strong>Alice <br></strong>And me, Alice. Hello.
17272	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In today's programme we're talking about <em>have to</em> and <em>mustâ€¦</em>
22566	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Have to and must. We'll look at what they meanâ€¦
26536	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We'll find out how to use them in sentencesâ€¦
30264	<strong>Alice<br></strong>We'll have a pronunciation tipâ€¦
32259	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we'll do some practice with a quiz.
35529	<strong>Alice <br></strong>So let's get started. We use both <em>must</em> and <em>have to</em> in front of verbs, to talk about obligations - things that are necessary.
46547	In natural English, they often have very similar meanings. And here's Catherine to demonstrate.
54822	<strong><strong>Catherine <br></strong></strong>I have to leave work early today. I must leave work early today.
61741	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Thanks Catherine. <em>I have to leave</em> and <em>I must leave</em>.
67314	Those sentences have pretty similar meanings - but that's not always the case.
73264	<strong>Alice <br></strong>So let's look more closely at <em>have to</em>. Catherine.
77481	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>My doctor says I have to lose weight. If you go to Russia, you have to get a visa.
85919	<strong>Alice <br></strong>So we use <em>have to </em>for things that are necessary - including laws.
92238	You can't go to some countries without a visa - you have to get one.
97009	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, with <em>have to</em>, the obligation usually comes from someone else: a doctor, a governmentâ€¦ or maybe your boss.
106352	<strong>Alice <br></strong>And this is where <em>must</em> is sometimes different.
110336	<em>Must</em> often suggests that the speaker decided themselves that it's necessary to do something.
116472	Here are some examples:
118268	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I'm putting on weight. I must join a gym.
121459	I haven't spoken to my sister this week. I must give her a call.
126590	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So that's <em>must</em> for personal necessities.
130901	<strong>Alice<br></strong>We can also use <em>must</em> to make recommendations, like this:
135488	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>When you go to Germany, you must try Bratwurst. It's delicious!
141676	<strong>Alice<br></strong>We sometimes see <em>mu</em>s<em>t</em> in formal notices or rules of an organisation.
147084	A hospital sign might say:
149505	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Visitors must wash their hands before leaving the ward.
153416	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Now, let's look at negatives. First: <em>don't have to</em>.
158120	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ok: if you <em>don't have to </em>do something, it isn't necessary to do it, but you can if you want. Catherine.
168231	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>In the UK, you don't have to drink alcohol in pubs.
172687	<strong>Alice<br></strong><em>Don't have to</em> means: it's your choice.
175728	But <em>mustn't</em> means: don't do it: It is necessary not to do it.
181635	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>You mustn't eat meat that's old.
185451	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In other words: don't eat meat that's old - it could make you ill.
190298	<strong>Alice <br></strong>So - we can use mustn't for both rules, and personal recommendations. Catherine.
196557	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>You mustn't forget to call your sister!
199358	Passengers must not speak to the driver while the bus is moving.
204801	<strong>Alice<br></strong><em>Passengers</em> <em>must not</em>â€¦ that sounds serious.
209115	<strong>Finn <br></strong>It does. The long form <em>must not</em> is more formal than the short form <em>mustn't</em>.
216025	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English dot com.
222256	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we're talking about must and have to. Now, a quick word about tenses.
227605	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes: it's important to note that we don't use <em>must </em>in the future or the past.
233786	Instead, it's <em>will have to</em> for the future and <em>had to</em> for the past. Catherine.
240799	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>You must talk to your doctor. You'll have to see her tomorrow.
245245	You didn't have to answer all the questions in yesterday's exam, but you must answer all the questions in today's exam.
254411	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Now: time for that pronunciation tip we promised you.
258359	<strong>Alice <br></strong>Yes: In natural speech, <em>have to</em> and <em>must</em> can get a bit squashed.
264087	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I have to go to the doctor. I must join a gym.
268301	<strong>Alice <br></strong>So <em>have to</em> sounds like <em>hafta: I have to </em>[hafta] go to the doctor. <em>Hafta.
275120	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And <em>must </em>sounds like '<em>mus'</em> without the final 't' sound: <em>I 'musjoin'</em> a gym.'<em>Mus'</em>.
284594	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So listen out for those sounds in our quiz.
287919	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Ooh yes, we must have a quiz before we go. I'll say a sentence with <em>must.</em>
295262	You decide if I'm talking about a rule or if it's just a personal recommendation.
301936	Ready? Number 1. <em>I</em> need some exercise. I must go to the gym.
308164	<strong>Alice <br></strong>And that's a personal recommendation.
311300	<strong>Finn <br></strong>That's rightâ€¦ number 2. Again, is this a rule or is it a personal recommendation?
318508	You mustn't smoke in the building.
321957	<strong>Alice <br></strong>No smoking in the buildings - that's a rule.
326103	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right. Number 3.
328792	I'm going to say a sentence in the present tense, and you have to put it into the past.
335859	Here goes: I must have a cup of tea!
339780	<strong>Alice <br></strong>And in the past it's: I had to have a cup of tea.
344166	<strong>Finn</strong><em> <br></em>Well done if you got all those right!
346831	<strong>Alice<br></strong>There's lots more about <em>must</em> and <em>have to</em> on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
351534	Join us again for more 6 Minute Grammar.
354032	<strong>All<br></strong>Bye.
