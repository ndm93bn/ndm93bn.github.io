1	(Introduction...)
11444	<strong>Finn</strong><strong> <br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
15444	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And me, Catherine. Hello.
17044	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>In todayâ€™s programme weâ€™re talking about three different verb patterns.
22444	First, what exactly do we mean by verb patterns, Catherine?
26444	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Well, here we mean the various language patterns that follow the main verb in a clause or sentence.
32888	And the first pattern weâ€™re looking at is verbs which are followed by <strong>that. </strong>Hereâ€™s our first example:
40400	<strong>Example<br></strong>My doctor<strong> explained that </strong>I had to go to hospital<strong>.
43700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>My doctor<strong> explained that </strong>I had to go to hospital<strong>.</strong>
47100	So, we have a verb â€“<strong> explain, </strong>plus<strong> that,</strong> and did you notice that the word <strong>that</strong> is followed by an independent clause?
57100	In other words, it's followed by a group of words with a subject and verb, just like like a full sentence.
64000	In our example the independent clause was: <strong>I had to go to hospital</strong>.
69333	Now, other verbs that take this pattern include <strong>say</strong>,<strong> warn</strong>,<strong> explain</strong>,<strong> suggest </strong>and<strong> know</strong>.
78138	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right. The second pattern is verbs that are followed by the i-n-g form, or <strong>-ing</strong> form of another verb. Let's have an example.
89109	<strong>Example<br></strong>We<strong> discussed waiting </strong>until next year.
91589	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, lots of verbs take this pattern, including <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> try</strong>,<strong> love</strong>,<strong> like</strong>,and<strong> hate</strong>.
99300	And the third pattern is verbs that are followed by the <strong>infinitive with to</strong>.
105111	<strong>Example<br></strong>He<strong> offered to see </strong>me again in a monthâ€™s time.
108700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And verbs that take this pattern include <strong>want</strong>, <strong>need</strong>, <strong>hope</strong>, <strong>love</strong> and <strong>promise</strong>.
117333	But itâ€™s important to know that with some verbs, you can choose between two of the patterns.
122977	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You can. So with the verbs <strong>suggest </strong>and<strong> recommend</strong> you can choose between <strong>that plus a clause</strong> or an <strong>â€“ing</strong> form. Here's an example:
134222	<strong>Example<br></strong>We <strong>suggest that</strong> you go to the hospital in Oxford.
137222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or:
138444	<strong>Example<br></strong>We <strong>suggest going</strong> to the hospital in Oxford.
141222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And with the verbs <strong>ask</strong>,<strong> propose </strong>and <strong>promise</strong>, you can choose between either <strong>that </strong>plus a clause, or the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>. Another example:
154400	<strong>Example<br></strong>I <strong>promised that</strong> I would let him know my decision.
157500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or:
158418	<strong>Example<br></strong>I <strong>promised to let</strong> him know my decision.
161100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>A good grammar book will give you a full list of verbs that take more than one pattern. Make sure you keep one handy!
168600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Top tip. Now, another point is that some of these verbs can take an object before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>.
176200	The verb<strong> ask </strong>is a good example. Listen to this:
179888	<strong>Example<br></strong>I <strong>asked the doctor to change </strong>my medication.

189196	<strong>Finn <br></strong>And weâ€™re looking at verb patterns. Well, weâ€™ve said that some verbs can have an object before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>.
198160	But there are a few verbs that must <strong>always</strong> have an object before the <strong>infinitive with</strong> <strong>to</strong>.
204555	The verbs <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> invite</strong>,<strong> tell</strong> and <strong>warn</strong> are like this.
210333	<strong>Example<br></strong>He <strong>advised me to think</strong> carefully about it. He <strong>told me not to</strong> hurry.
215329	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. Actually that last example is an interesting one.
219555	It shows that when you use a negative form with the infinitive, the word <strong>not</strong> goes before, not after, the infinitive with <strong>to</strong>.
229444	Like this â€“ He <strong>told me not to hurry.
232888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Good point. The verbs <strong>advise</strong>,<strong> ask </strong>and<strong> warn</strong> are like that too, arenâ€™t they?
239222	He <strong>advised </strong><strong>me not to worry</strong>, for example.
242804	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, thatâ€™s right. Of course, you can use <strong>not</strong> before <strong>-ing</strong> forms as well. Listen to this:
249222	<strong>Example<br></strong>They <strong>recommend not eating</strong> a big meal in the evening.
252600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But infinitives are a bit different because you lose the word <strong>to</strong> in the negative. So itâ€™s possible to say:
260782	<strong>Example <br></strong>They <strong>recommend that you not eat</strong> a big meal in the evening.
264444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But that sounds very formal. We usually use <strong>donâ€™t</strong> instead of <strong>not</strong>.
270555	<strong>Example<br></strong>They <strong>recommend that you donâ€™t eat</strong> a big meal in the evening.
274333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, by now you have probably noticed that most of the verbs we are talking about belong to a particular type.
281000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Exactly. They are mostly verbs that explain, suggest, advise, offer, promise, report or warn.
289951	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Try to look out for these verbs and youâ€™ll soon get to know which patterns you need to use.
295333	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>And now: itâ€™s quiz time! Which sentence is correct?
301888	a) Carl explained me he would be late home.
306999	b) Carl explained that he would be late home.
311444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>b) is correct. Carl explained that he would be late home.
316666	Number 2. Which is correct?
319111	a) Which day do you advise us to come?
322307	b) Which day do you advise that we come?
326100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Aha. Both a) and b) are correct!
330000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Aha, yes.
331000	<strong>Finn</strong>  <br>Which day do you advise us to come? and Which day do you advise that we come?
336304	Right, number three. a) She warned me not to go out.
341489	b) She warned me not going out.
345222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And a) is correct. She warned me not to go out.
349122	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And that is the end of the quiz. Congratulations if you got them all right.
354222	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Congratulations indeed. And thatâ€™s all for now about verb patterns, but thereâ€™s more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
