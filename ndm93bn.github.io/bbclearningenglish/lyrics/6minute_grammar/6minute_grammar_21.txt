1	(Introduction...)
11909	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Catherine.
16235	<strong>Finn <br></strong>And me, Finn. And in today's programme we're talking aboutâ€¦ Oww!
21600	You hit me! Catherine! That hurt!
26300	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, Finn, I hit you.
28200	<strong>Finn <br></strong>I hope there's a grammatical reason for that!
30900	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Always, Finn. I wouldn't hit you without a good reason.
33961	And the reason is, we're talking about active and passive voice today.
38732	And in the active voice we say <strong>Catherine hit Finn</strong>: subject - verb - object. Like this:
47000	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Oww! You hit me again!!
51000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>All in the name of grammar.
52474	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK. <strong>You hit me</strong>. Subject - verb â€“ object.
56200	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>That's right. So, speaking grammatically, the subject â€“ that's me â€“ performs or does the actionâ€¦
62944	<strong>Finn <br></strong>And the object of the verb â€“ thatâ€™s me - receives or gets the action.
68200	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Another one?
69162	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No. Catherine hit Finn.
71924	But of course I'm more important than you Catherine, so I want to be at the beginning of the sentence.
78000	Let's say it this way: Finn was hit by Catherine. Don't do it again.
83200	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Ok - Finn was hit by Catherine.
87004	We put the receiver of the verb at the beginning of the sentence, plus the verb <strong>to be</strong> and the past participle, to make a passive sentence: Finn was hit by Catherine.
99412	So here's Rob with some examples of active and passive sentences. First an active sentence:
106267	<strong>Rob <br></strong>Millions of people use the internet.
109265	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And with the receiver of the verb at the beginning of the sentence â€“ in the passive voice.
114364	<strong>Rob <br></strong>The internet is used by millions of people.
117484	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Active:
118477	<strong>Rob<br></strong>A thief stole my car.
120703	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Passive:
121486	<strong>Rob <br></strong>My car was stolen by a thief.
123853	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Active:
124999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Somebody rescued the child.
127311	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Passive:
128302	<strong>Rob<br></strong>The child was rescued by somebody.
130573	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>Thanks Rob. And now that Catherine has stopped hitting me, we can look at that last pair of sentences more closely.
138119	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>OK.
139072	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Thank you. Right, in many situations, the passive sentence <strong>the child was rescued</strong> would sound more natural than <strong>somebody rescued the child</strong> - now, that's if we feel the child is more important than the rescuer.
154803	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Yes - and we don't know who rescued the child, so we don't need to say <strong>by somebody</strong>.
160603	It's just: <strong>The child was rescued</strong>.
163378	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's right - if you don't know who or what is doing the verb, or if it's not important, or if it's obvious, you can leave it out completely, like this:
173041	<strong>Rob</strong> <br>My car was stolen.
175260	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Let's have another sentence in active voice:
179000	<strong>Rob <br>The storm destroyed the bridge</strong>.
180938	<strong>Finn <br></strong>And here it is in passive voice:
183369	<strong>Rob <br>The bridge was destroyed by the storm</strong>.
186191	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Here, the subject - the storm - is important, so we don't leave it out.
192522	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>You're listening to bbclearningenglish.com.
198294	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And we're talking about active and passive voice.
201333	<strong>Finn <br></strong>That's right. When the thing receiving the action of the verb is important, you can show this importance, by putting it at the start of the sentence, and using the verb <strong>to be</strong> plus the past participle of the verb to make a passive form.
217265	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And if the person or thing doing the verb is obvious, unimportant or unknown, you can leave it out.
230404	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Now for our quiz. Which of these news headlines sounds better: is it a):
237652	<strong>Rob<br></strong>85-year-old Mary Hiker has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
242250	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Or b):
243820	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Mount Kilimanjaro has been climbed by an 85-year-old, Mary Hiker.
248915	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Well, they are grammatically correct, but the active sentence a) is the best - if you agree that the name and age of the climber is more important than the name of the mountain she climbed!
260100	<strong>Rob<br></strong>85-year-old Mary Hiker has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
264405	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Next up - option a):
266545	<strong>Rob <br></strong>The police arrested the burglars and took them to the police station.
271102	<strong>Finn <br></strong>And option b):
273026	<strong>Rob<br></strong>The burglars were arrested and taken to the police station.
276810	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And the passive in option b) is best - we can guess that the police arrested the burglars, so we don't need to mention them.
284396	<strong>Rob <br></strong>The burglars were arrested and taken to the police station.
288011	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>And the last one - option a):
290913	<strong>Rob<br></strong>William posted a photo of his birthday party on his webpage.
295079	<strong>Finn <br></strong>And option b):
296926	<strong>Rob<br></strong>A photo of William's birthday party was posted by him on his webpage.
301806	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And option a) sounds much better - because William is most definitely the subject of this sentence!
308608	<strong>Rob<br></strong>William posted a photo of his birthday party on his webpage.
312788	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>Now, here's a tip for using the passive voice in spoken English.
317467	You may hear people use the verb <strong>get</strong> instead of the verb <strong>be</strong>, like this:
322999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Your bike will <strong>get stolen</strong> if you don't lock it!
326400	<strong>Finn <br></strong>Right. And if you hit your colleagues, Catherine?
329800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>If you hit your colleagues for a non-grammatical reason, Finn, you will get into trouble.
337622	<strong>Finn <br></strong>OK, thank you very much, and there we are: the passive voice is made with an object, plus the verb to be, plus the past participle.
347280	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And we use it when we're more interested in the object of a verb, or if the subject is unknown or obvious.
354115	<strong>Finn</strong> <br>There's more about this on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
