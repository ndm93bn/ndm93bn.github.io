1	(Introduction...)
14002	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Sophie.
17261	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And me, Neil. Hello.
20055	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Today we're talking about the present simple tenseâ€¦
23302	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...and the present continuous tense. Coming up in today's programme:
29491	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>We'll take a look at positives, negatives, and question formsâ€¦
33433	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We'll find out when to use each tenseâ€¦
35987	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>We'll hear some short formsâ€¦
37620	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And we'll have a quiz to test what we've learnt.
41782	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>But first: the present simple tense.
44962	We use it to talk about things that happen regularly. Here's Finn with an example:
50116	<strong>Finn<br></strong>John checks his email every morning.
54189	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Thanks Finn. So the verb <strong>to check</strong> is in the present simple - <strong>John checks </strong>- because he checks his email regularly - every morning.
63220	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We make the present simple with a subject plus a base verb - <strong>I check, you go, we live, they wear</strong><em>.
71864	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>For <strong>he</strong>, <strong>she</strong> and <strong>it</strong>, add an <strong>s</strong> to the verb.
74667	Can you demonstrate please Finn?
75472	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I always weÂ­ar a coat in the winter. My brother wears a jacket.
82222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now we also use the present simple to talk about facts and permanent situations. So we can sayâ€¦
90244	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I work in the fashion industry. My sister lives in China<em>.
95824	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>To make the present simple negative, use <strong>don't </strong>or <strong>doesn't</strong>.
101015	And there's no <strong>s </strong>on the end of the verb. Finn?
104253	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I don't work in the modelling industry. My brother doesn't like fashion.
110203	<strong>Neil<br></strong>For questions, use <strong>do </strong>or <strong>does</strong>.
113946	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Do your friends live in London? Does John check his email in the morning?
119934	<strong>STING</strong>
122023	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So that's present simple. Now: let's look at the present continuous tense.
127669	[SFX: phone rings] Ooh just a minute, let me get thatâ€¦ [to caller] Hello?
132899	Sorry, <em>I'm working</em> <em>at the moment.
136719	Can I call you back? Sorry about that everyoneâ€¦
141569	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>[bemused] No problemâ€¦
143260	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So: I just said <em>I'm working at the moment.
146724	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Aha! A clever demonstration!
148961	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right - I said<em> I'm working at the moment, </em>because it's an activity that's happening now.
155888	I can say <em>I work at the BBC</em> in the present simple because my job is a permanent situation.
163379	But right now at this moment I'm doing the activity of working, so I use present continuous to say <em>I'm working at the moment.
173595	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Right. As well as activities, we use the present continuous tense for temporary situations like this:
180364	<strong>Finn<br></strong>My parents are staying with me this week. I'm sleeping on the sofa.
185841	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Ok. To make the present continuous, use <strong>am</strong>, <strong>is </strong>or <strong>are </strong>plus an <strong>i-n-g</strong> verb.
194101	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I'm checking my email at the moment. Emily's wearing a pink hat today. They're eating dinner now.
203110	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And did you hear those short forms? The words <strong>I am </strong>are shortened to <strong>I'm</strong><em>â€¦</em>
210570	<strong>Sophie<br>Emily is </strong>sounds like<strong> Emily's</strong>.
213815	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>they are </strong>sounds like <strong>they're</strong>. We'll have short forms in just a moment.
221429	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
226775	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And today we're talking about the present simple tenseâ€¦
230310	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦ and the present continuous.
231943	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Let's look at present continuous negatives. We make them with the little word <em>not</em>.
238532	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I'm not wearing a raincoat because it isn't raining.
242878	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And here are those short forms again:
245034	<strong>Neil<br>I am not </strong>becomesâ€¦
247428	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦<strong> I'm not.
248381	<strong>Neil<br>Is not</strong>â€¦
250165	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦ <strong>isn't</strong>
250845	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And for <strong>are not </strong>we getâ€¦
254169	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦ <strong>aren't</strong><em>.
254873	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I'm not wearing shoes. He isn't working today. You aren't watching television.
254873	<strong>[SFX: someone tapping keys on keyboard]</strong>
255406	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Umm Neil, are you sending an email?
257883	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Errr - yesâ€¦ [slightly bewildered] What are we doing? Are we talking about questions?
265385	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Yes, we are.
266569	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ooh, sorry - Back to the programme!
270073	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Aha! Another clever demonstration! I said: <em>Are you sending an email?
274863	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said: <em>Are we talking about questions?
278061	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And of course, we both asked present continuous yes/no questions.
282663	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And to make them, you just change the word order.
285786	Instead of <em>You are</em><em> sending an email</em>, it's <em>Are you</em><em> sending an email?
290825	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And change <em>We are</em><em> talking about questions</em> to <em>Are we</em><em> talking about questions?
291759	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's fine to put question words like <strong>why </strong>or <strong>what </strong>at the start of the question.
297412	<strong>Finn<br></strong>What are we doing? Why are you sending an email?
301823	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So that's present continuous questions.
305837	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>So that means: it's time for a quiz. Join in if you like.
309064	I'm going to say a sentence and you need to make it negative. Neil will give the answer.
313917	Ready? Number 1. <em>Paolo speaks Chinese.
318572	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Paolo doesn't speak Chinese.
321745	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Now make this sentence into a yes/no question: <em>The children are playing a game.
329038	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Are the children playing a game?
332148	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And one more: this time, make a present continuous question starting with <strong>why</strong>.
338285	<em>Simon is learning Japanese</em>.
342422	<strong>Neil<br></strong><em>Why is</em> <em>Simon learning Japanese</em>?
346333	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And that's the end of the quiz - well done if you got them all right.
350538	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that's also the end of the programme - but there's more about these tenses on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.
