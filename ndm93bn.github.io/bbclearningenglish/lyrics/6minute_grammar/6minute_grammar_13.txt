1	(Introduction...)
5579	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me Catherine.
9325	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And me, Neil. Hello.
15511	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>In this programme we're talking about <strong>state verbs</strong>. We'll explain what they are.
21110	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We'll show you how to use them.
23091	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We'll give you lots of examples.
24943	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And we'll finish with a quiz to see what you've learnt.
28330	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So let's get started.
32370	We can separate English verbs into two groups<strong>: state verbs</strong> and <strong>action verbs</strong>.
39939	Most verbs are action verbs.
42386	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And of course action verbs describe actions, so verbs like <strong>go, kick, watch, rain </strong>are all <strong>action</strong> <strong>verbs</strong>.
51448	And we can use them in any tense we want - past, present, future, perfect, passive, continuous, the lot.
58110	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes but state verbs are different - because we don't usually use them in the continuous tenses.
64277	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. We don't use state verbs in tenses that use the <strong>i-n-g</strong> form, such as the present continuous and the past continuous.
73123	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, now, you're probably asking: what kind of verbs are state verbs?
76983	Well, there are three main types.
79217	The first type is verbs that describe <strong>feelings and attitudes</strong> such as <strong>love, hate, like</strong> and <strong>prefer</strong>.
87210	Here's Harry with an example.
89417	<strong>Harry<br></strong>What's this music? <strong>I like </strong>it.
92255	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thanks Harry. In that example, Harry is talking about his feelings now, but he doesn't say <strong>I'm liking it</strong>.
100604	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, <strong>I'm liking </strong>is the present continuous tense and with state verbs that's usually wrong.
106889	We'll say a bit more about this later on, but the general rule is: use the present simple for verbs of feelings like <strong>love</strong>, <strong>like</strong> and <strong>hate</strong>.
117711	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now for the second type of state verb: that's verbs of <strong>thinking</strong>.
122639	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So verbs like <strong>think, know, believe, understand, remember</strong>. Here are some examples.
130123	<strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>I believe</strong> Andrew's living in Dubai now.
133566	<strong>Do you remember</strong> if he's married?
135788	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. In this example, Harry's using the present simple tense with the verbs <strong>believe</strong> and <strong>remember</strong>.
143277	You can't use them in the continuous.
145964	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the third group of state verbs are verbs that describe <strong>senses</strong>.
150469	Verbs like <strong>see, smell, taste, hear</strong> and <strong>sound.</strong>
156346	Another example, please Harry.
158210	<strong>Harry<br></strong>What are you eating? <strong>It smells</strong> delicious!
161714	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So Harry says <strong>it smells </strong>delicious and not <strong>it's smelling</strong> delicious.
167024	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. That would be wrong because <strong>smell</strong> is a state verb.
171141	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is. And as well as these three main types, there are some other common state verbs, for example: <strong>have, own, belong</strong>.
180323	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...<strong>want</strong>, <strong>need</strong>, <strong>mean</strong>.
183313	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...<strong>cost</strong>, <strong>seem</strong>, <strong>appear </strong>and<strong> wish.
187913	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's quite a lot of verbs to remember.
191407	But one way to decide if a verb is a state verb is to ask yourself: does it describe an action?
198340	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good tip. And if the answer is "no it doesn't", then it's probably a state verb.
204133	<strong>IDENT <br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from bbclearningenglish.com.
209628	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And we're looking at state verbs.
212102	OK so far? Good. Now: couple of points to make.
215845	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. A few verbs can have two meanings.
218928	In one meaning, they are an action verb, so you can use them in the present continuous.
223769	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>But in the other meaning, they are state verbs, so you can't use a continuous tense.
228925	Some examples please Harry:
230333	<strong>Harry<br></strong>Mick <strong>looks like</strong> his sister.
233427	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And:
234978	<strong>Harry<br></strong>Mick's <strong>looking at</strong> his sister.
237360	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thanks. So, in the first example, <strong>Mick looks like his sister, looks</strong> is a state verb.
244322	We're talking about Mick's appearance, not his actions.
248030	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But in the second example, <strong>Mick's looking at his sister</strong>, Mick's doing something.
253873	So, in this sentence, <strong>look</strong> is an action verb.
257215	<strong>Neil <br></strong>Another verb with two meanings like this is <strong>have</strong>, for example:<strong> I have a cat </strong>but <strong>I'm having a bath.
265973	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>think</strong>. Listen.
268044	<strong>I think you're right</strong> - but - <strong>I'm thinking of going to Spain</strong>.
272881	And all the sense verbs can have two meanings too. Another example, Harry?
278214	<strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>Can you see </strong>that man?
280796	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And:
282046	<strong>Harry<br></strong><strong>I'm seeing</strong> the doctor.
284643	<strong>Neil <br></strong>Right. Now, do you remember that we said it's wrong to say <strong>I'm liking it</strong> because it's the present continuous?
292487	Well, you might hear this sometimes in very informal spoken English.
298115	Or you might hear <strong>I'm hating this movie</strong> or <strong>I'm loving your work.</strong>
302839	But only in very informal conversations.
306478	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thanks for that Neil, I'm loving your explanations.
310586	And now it's quiz time! Are these sentences correct or wrong?
315508	Number one: <strong>Do you prefer</strong> jazz or rock music?
322029	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that is correct.
324887	<strong>Prefer</strong> is a state verb so we use the present simple tense: <strong>Do you prefer</strong>.?
329963	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done! Number two: <strong>Are you belonging</strong> to the football club?
333280	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's not correct. Belong is a state verb.
339523	We have to say <strong>Do you belong.?</strong>Not: <strong>Are you belonging.?
344137	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right again!Number three: <strong>I'm having</strong> lunch with Kate today.
349357	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that is correct.
352347	<strong>Have</strong> is an action verb here, so it's fine to use the present continuous tense.
357778	In this sentence, <strong>I'm having</strong> means <strong>I'm eating.
361187	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done if got them all right.
