10878	<strong>Callum <br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar, I'm Callum.
13900	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>And I'm Catherine, hello.
15222	<strong>Callum</strong> <br>In this programme we're talking about the definite article with abstract uncountable nouns.
20700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, we'll explain what that all means.
23166	<strong>Callum <br></strong>And we'll end up with a quiz to see if we've done a good job.
26111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>No pressure then!
26975	<strong>Callum <br></strong>Indeed. To start with, let's just remind everyone about the terms we're using.
32300	First, there's the definite article. What's that, Catherine?
35992	<strong>Catherine <br></strong><strong>The</strong>.
37222	<strong>Callum <br></strong>The what?
38400	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Just <strong>the</strong>.
39777	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Just the what?
40800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You're doing this on purpose, aren't you Callum?
43268	The definite article is the word <strong>the</strong>. Articles are used before nouns.
49500	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Today's topic is using <strong>the</strong> with abstract uncountable nouns. Tell us about those.
55333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Now, before I get to the abstract part, let's just remind everybody about uncountable nouns, which you might also hear described as mass nouns.
65899	These are nouns that, as the name suggests, you can't count. They have no plural form. Words like air, water, cheese, money.
77972	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Wait a minute.
78800	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Yes?
79555	<strong>Callum</strong><br>Did you say money?
80722	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes.
81400	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Did you say you can't count money?
83555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. You can't count money, at least not grammatically.
87888	You can't count money in the same way as you can count, for example, chairs.
92500	Because, when you count chairs, you can just give a number.
96000	How many chairs are there? Three, ten, 2,150.
101100	But if I ask you Callum how much money you have in your pocket, what would you say?
106888	<strong>Callum<br></strong>OK, well, let me see. I've got five, ten. I've got Â£15. So I can count money, surely?
116933	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, you've got <strong>15 pounds</strong>. But you haven't got <strong>15 moneys</strong>.
122600	So, pounds are countable, money isn't. We are counting the pounds.
128777	<strong>Callum<br></strong>I see, and what are abstract uncountable nouns then?
132900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, before we go to abstract, let's first talk about the concrete ones.
137555	Concrete uncountable nouns are things that you can physically experience, that's things that you can touch, see, hear, smell or taste.
146600	But abstract nouns don't refer to these physical things.
151000	Abstract nouns refer to ideas, feelings, emotions, qualities and concepts.
157148	So, things like: <strong>love</strong>, <strong>fun</strong>, <strong>happiness</strong>, <strong>bravery</strong>, <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>enthusiasm</strong> and <strong>childhood.
164141	<strong>Callum<br></strong>But I'm sure I experienced <strong>childhood</strong>. It seemed pretty real to me.
168444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, because we describe something as abstract, it doesn't mean it isn't real.
173000	You certainly were a child Callum at some time, whenever that was. But the period of time when you were a child.
181000	all the experiences that you had when you were growing up. aren't physical things.
185792	Together they make an idea or a concept that we call <strong>childhood</strong>.

198695	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Today we're looking at using the definite article with abstract uncountable nouns.
204100	We've defined our terms, so now let's look at how these two go together.
208702	Catherine, can we use <strong>the </strong>with abstract uncountable nouns?
212900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, Callum, it depends on the context.
215700	If we are talking about something in general, we don't use the definite article. Here's Finn, with an example.
222666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It can be difficult to find <strong>happiness.
226464	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The abstract noun there is <strong>happiness</strong>.
229325	Here we're talking about <strong>happiness</strong> in general, we don't use the definite article.
234800	Now compare that use of <strong>happiness</strong>, with this one.
238444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I can't express <strong>the happiness</strong> that I felt when my son was born.
243217	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now in this case, are we talking about <strong>happiness</strong> in general?
247762	<strong>Callum<br></strong>No, we're talking about a specific time, a particular moment when there was <strong>happiness</strong>.
254000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, so in this case, because it is referring to a particular time we do need to use <strong>the definite article</strong>.
261424	Note that after the noun <strong>the happiness </strong>there is a phrase that points to the exact time being described. And in this case the phrase is:
270804	<strong>Callum<br></strong>That I felt when my son was born.
273200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. And that phrase is a defining relative clause.
277418	When there is a defining relative clause following an abstract uncountable noun, the chances are the noun will have the definite article in front of it.
287902	<strong>Callum<br></strong>So we know that the definite article <strong>the </strong>is used with abstract uncountable nouns when we are talking about a specific example of that noun.
296700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And when we are talking about that noun in general, we don't use any article.
301927	<strong>Callum<br></strong>I think it's time for a little quiz.
304256	Listen to each sentence and decide if the use of the article is correct or not. Finn, number one please.
311222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I've got a lot of the ambition.
313925	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that one is...not correct.
317086	<strong>Ambition</strong> is the noun but it shouldn't have the definite article. Next one please, Finn.
322639	<strong>Finn<br></strong>He had the confidence that is needed to sing in public.
327111	<strong>Callum<br></strong>That is correct. The noun is <strong>confidence</strong> and as the particular example of confidence is defined, we do need <strong>the</strong>. Last question, please.
338334	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Love is all you need.
340717	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Of course, that one is correct.
343444	<strong>Love</strong> is the noun and it refers to the idea of love in general so no definite article. Well done if you got all those right.
