11888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Grammar with me, Finn.
18111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Sorry I'm so late, Finn.
21200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh Robâ€¦ OK.
22666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>There was such a long queue at the coffee machine.
25555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ah<strong> so late</strong>â€¦<strong>such a long queue</strong> â€“ great examples for today's topic, Rob.
32600	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. Thank you very much. Yes, weâ€™re talking about <strong>so, such, too</strong> and <strong>enough</strong>.
40666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>When Rob said he was <strong>so late,</strong> he meant he was very late.
46388	Now Helen has some more examples using <strong>so</strong>.
50555	<strong>Helen<br></strong>This coffee is so good. Finn speaks English so well.
56888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So it's<strong> so</strong> before an adjective â€“ This coffee is <strong>so good</strong>â€¦<strong> so strong</strong>â€¦<strong> so hot</strong>â€¦
65650	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Sounds good. Or before an <strong>adverb</strong>: He speaks English <strong>so well</strong>â€¦<strong> so fluently</strong>â€¦<strong> so fast</strong>.
75111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we use <strong>such</strong> with a noun. Rob said there was <strong>such a long queue</strong>, meaning the queue was very long. Here are more examples.
86167	<strong>Helen<br></strong>My holiday was such fun!
88928	My holiday was such a disaster!
92666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We say <strong>such</strong> <strong>fun </strong>without the indefinite article <strong>a </strong>because fun is uncountable.
99222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But it's <strong>such a</strong> <strong>disaster</strong> with the article because <strong>disaster </strong>is countable.
107555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now we often use <strong>such </strong>with an adjective and a noun together. Listen to this.
112999	<strong>Helen<br></strong>Adele has such an amazing voice.
116149	We had such good weather in Greece.
119700	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So it's <strong>such</strong> good weatherâ€¦ <strong>such</strong> an amazing voice.
124700	Remember: with countable nouns put the <strong>a</strong> or <strong>an</strong> after 'such' not before.
131555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Nowadays, you sometimes hear people use <strong>so</strong> with a <strong>noun</strong> or <strong>verb </strong>for emphasis. Like this.
140444	<strong>Helen<br></strong>That dress is so last year.
143777	I'm so going to hug her when I see her.
147850	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So if you say<strong> 'so last year'</strong> it means really not fashionable any more.
154800	<strong>So going to hug her</strong> means really going to give her a really good hug.
161000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We can use <strong>so</strong> and <strong>such</strong> with a <strong>that clause</strong> to describe cause and effect. Like this.
167777	<strong>Helen<br></strong>It was so hot that they had to go indoors.
171888	It was such a hot day that they had to stay indoors.
175921	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we can leave <strong>that</strong> out, so we could say: <strong>It was so hot they had to go indoors</strong>.
184119	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We also use <strong>so</strong> with <strong>many</strong> or <strong>much</strong> and a noun to describe a lot of something.
190666	It's <strong>so much</strong> with<strong> uncountable nouns</strong> and <strong>so many</strong> with <strong>countable nouns</strong>.
196111	<strong>Helen<br></strong>What a great party! I had <strong>so much</strong> <strong>fun</strong>.
200888	We visited <strong>so many places</strong>.
205130	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So that's <strong>so</strong> and <strong>such</strong>. Now for <strong>too</strong> and <strong>enough</strong>.
212044	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. Now we use<strong> enough</strong> with an adjective or adverb to say something is or isn't the right degree.
220000	So, if I ask Finn: <strong>Are you warm enough, Finn?
222700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I am, thanks.
223999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I'm asking if it's the right temperature for you.
226988	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Notice <strong>enough</strong> comes after the adjective or adverb.
231900	We can also use <strong>enough</strong> after a verb.
236288	<strong>Helen<br></strong>He doesn't <strong>sleep enough</strong>. He's always tired.
240999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>When we use <strong>enough</strong> with a noun, it goes before the noun.
245666	We have <strong>enough food, enough time</strong>.
248658	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And sentences with <strong>enough</strong> are sometimes followed by <strong>to </strong>and a<strong> verb.
255666	<strong>Helen<br></strong>She's definitely <strong>smart enough</strong> <strong>to become</strong> director.
260777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You know Rob, I think that's enough about enough!
264700	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Indeed. Now to say there's more than necessary, we use <strong>too</strong> with an adjective or adverb.
272002	So we could say this office is <strong>too crowded, too noisy, too busy</strong>.
276800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And I could say Rob that you're working <strong>too hard</strong>.
281061	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thank you very much.
282000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>You work very hard.
283111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We can use <strong>too much</strong> or <strong>too many</strong> with a<strong> noun </strong>to say we have more than we need.
289333	<strong>Helen<br></strong>Ugh! You've put<strong> too much sugar </strong>in my tea!
294111	I ate <strong>too many biscuits</strong>.
297497	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Grammar from BBC Learning English.
303111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And I think we have just enough time for a quiz.
309000	OK so which is correct, a or b? Are you ready Rob?
312800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I am.
313500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>OK. Number one. a) That's a so cute dog! b) That's such a cute dog.
320924	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well it's b) because it's <strong>such</strong> with an adjective and noun and the indefinite article comes after not before.
329777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>That's correct. Number 2. a) Is there money enough? Or b) Is there enough money?
338222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, that's b) again because enough goes before a noun.
342666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Correct. And finally, number 3.
345600	a) I can't afford it. It's too expensive.
350168	Or b) I can't afford it. It's so expensive.
354111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>You're trying to trick me. Both are correct.
356700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Of course. That's right. Well done if you got them all right at home.
