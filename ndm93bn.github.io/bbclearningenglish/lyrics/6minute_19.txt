11865	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14393	I'm Alice.
15119	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>And I'm Rob.
16004	Now, Alice, what did you get up to at the weekend?
18500	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I did some <strong>spring-cleaning</strong>, which means cleaning a place very well, especially places you don't clean often.
25572	So, I was tidying up my wardrobe, trying to organise things.
30140	and suddenly hundreds of shoes tumbled on my head!
33351	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Poor Alice!
34354	But why do you have so many shoes?
36284	And why do you keep them at the top of your wardrobe?
39548	I only have three pairs.
40796	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I like to match my shoes to my outfit - and three pairs wouldn't do the trick.
45095	Well, the subject of today's show is having too much stuff.
49596	And you're making me feel guilty, Rob.
52071	You must have too much of something.
53895	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, plastic bags.
55644	I think they're useful, but they're getting <strong>out of hand</strong> - and that means not under control.
60754	They're taking over my kitchen!
62311	<strong>Alice<br></strong>You can recycle plastic bags, you know, Rob?
65159	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, you can recycle shoes too, you know, Alice!
67463	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
68167	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now, usually I don't have a lot of <strong>clutter</strong> in my flat - and that means an untidy collection of objects.
74994	Clutter makes it harder to find the things you need.
77831	And it makes moving house a nightmare!
81042	All those boxes full of things you don't need.
83602	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Good point.
84647	I have a friend who suggested the three buckets system.
88370	You sort things into three different buckets: one you label as 'to keep', one as 'to get rid of', one as 'maybe to get rid of'.
99047	<strong>Get rid of</strong>, by the way, means to remove something you don't want.
103143	It's the 'maybe' bucket that's tricky, isn't it?
105916	- You never know if you might need something in the future.
108466	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, it would need to be a big bucket too.
110610	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, it would.
111516	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, l think we could all live better with less.
114588	OK, well, let's have today's quiz question before we talk more about de-cluttering our lives: So which word, Alice, means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life?
126524	Is it.
127271	<br>a) metaphysics?
128668	<br>b) materialism?
130514	<br>Or c) existentialism?
133106	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK.
134386	I think it's b) materialism.
139015	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK.
139794	Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show.
144092	Now let's listen to Bea Johnson, author of <em>Zero Waste Home</em> talking about how she and her family have adopted a <strong>minimalist</strong> - or deliberately simple - lifestyle in their California home.
156882	<strong>INSERT<br> Bea Johnson, minimalist and author of <em>Zero Waste Home<br></em></strong>We've really asked ourselves 'what is it that we really need?
161660	' We've asked really true questions, and evaluated every single thing that we have.
167378	There is nothing that we overlooked.
169575	I even came to one day look at my vegetable peeler for example and asked myself, 'Do I really need that vegetable peeler'?
178834	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So one day Bea Johnson decided to <strong>evaluate</strong>, or to judge the importance of something, to see if she needed it.
188519	<strong>Alice<br></strong>She evaluated her vegetable peeler and decided to put it in the 'get rid of' bucket!
194546	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, and to <strong>overlook</strong> something means not to see it.
198311	Now, I don't blame Bea at all because I don't like peeling vegetables either.
202674	And you could actually get the benefit of the vitamins and minerals by eating the skins.
207164	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Very healthy, Rob!
208892	<strong>Rob<br></strong>We can really live with fewer things.
211124	But some people can't help looking for the latest version of something or go for designer goods.
217236	Writer and journalist James Wallman warns us about this.
221001	He wonders how much stuff is too much.
224351	<strong>INSERT<br> James Wallman, writer and journalist<br></strong>This thing about need is such a dangerous term because what do you need?
230601	And I'm not anti-stuff - stuff is good.
233119	I'm anti too much stuff and I'm anti the wrong stuff.
236230	Don't go out and buy that labelled good that you think is going to make people think something more of you.
242417	That's not going to make you happy.
244316	<strong>Rob<br></strong>James Wallman there.
247240	Now, Alice, do you buy labelled goods?
250195	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I'm afraid I do.
251784	And <strong>labelled</strong> goods or products are the ones with a famous brand name, like Gucci, Dior, Prada etc.
259624	But I do think James Wallman is right - buying things just because other people have them, for example, doesn't make us happy.
266558	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yeah, that's true, but as he says, not everything is the wrong stuff.
271283	For example, I'm very fond of my large schoolboy collection of superhero comics.
276136	I might not need them, but they make me happy.
279208	So what stuff makes you happy, Alice?
281822	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh, well, I like my music CDs and my books - even though I've got the music on an mp3 player and I don't often pull a book out from the bookcase.
290067	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They have <strong>sentimental value</strong>, don't they?
292382	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
293032	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And that means the importance of something because of a personal or emotional feeling that we attach to it.
298088	Well, I sold all my music CDs online ages ago.
301886	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That sounds like the sensible thing to do.
304275	OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Rob.
308509	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, I asked you: Which word means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life?
314856	Is it.
315838	a) metaphysics, b) materialism or c) existentialism?
321064	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I said b) materialism.
324883	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And you were right, Alice!
326319	Well done!
326884	The answer is indeed b) materialism.
329529	This is the word used to refer to a desire for material things and wealth and little or no interest in ethical values.
337327	Now, can we hear the words we learned today please, Alice?
340889	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, of course.
341828	They are:<br><br>spring-cleaning<br>out of hand<br>clutter<br>get rid of<br>materialism<br>minimalist<br>evaluate<br>overlook<br>labelled<br>sentimental value
363481	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
367311	Don't forget to join us again soon!
368943	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye.
