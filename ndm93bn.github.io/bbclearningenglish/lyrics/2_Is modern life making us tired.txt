10508	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14471	I'm Aliceâ€¦
15402	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ and I'm Neil.
16170	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So Neil, did you sleep well last night?
18109	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Um, yes, thanks.
19443	Why do you ask?
20334	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Today we're talking about how much sleep we need.
23527	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I like a good eight hours myself - ten at the weekend.
27288	How about you?
28422	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Six is enough for me.
29796	But did you know this?
31573	Humans sleep around three hours less than other primates like chimps, who sleep for about ten hours.
38169	So you're a chimp, Neil - at the weekends, at least!
42780	Are you ready for the quiz question?
47674	<strong>Neil<br></strong>[makes some chimp noises]
49534	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK, I'll assume that means yes.
52241	Right.
54949	What's another word for sleepwalking?
56931	Is itâ€¦<br>a) narcolepsy?
60206	<br>b) restless legs syndrome?
62917	<br>or c) somnambulism?
65423	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I will go for b) restless legs syndrome, since there's a connection there with the legs.
70152	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well we'll find out whether you're right or wrong later on in the show.
73670	So what keeps you awake at night, Neil?
76822	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Not much, to be honest.
77997	I usually <strong>sleep like a log</strong> - and that means very heavily indeed!
81719	But sometimes my own snoring wakes me up, and then I can find it hard to get back to sleep.
86972	<strong>Snoring</strong>, for those of you who don't know, means breathing in a noisy way through your mouth or nose while you're asleep.
94451	[snores] â€¦ like thatâ€¦ How about you, Alice?
98170	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Very good, yes.
99745	Well, that's quite ridiculous!
101160	Anyway, for me, it's drinking too much coffee during the day.
105250	It's the <strong>caffeine</strong> in coffee - a chemical that makes you feel more awake - which can stop you from sleeping at night.
112275	But there are so many things that can keep us awake these days.
115425	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh yes.
116233	Radio, TVâ€¦ techy stuff like 24-hour internet, computers, smart phones.
121404	I love my phone and it's never far from me!
123465	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, let's hear what Professor Jerome Siegel, from the University of California, found when he studied the sleep habits of three different hunter-gatherer communities who have very little contact with modern society.
134495	They don't have artificial light, electricity, batteries, or any of the gadgets that we rely on today.
140757	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Professor Jerome Siegel, from the University of California, US<br></strong>Their sleep was not that different from ours.
144675	The range of sleep period was about 6.
149527	9 to 8.
150458	5 hours.
151672	If you actually measure sleep in current populations in the United States or in Europe they're definitely at the low end of what's been reported.
161572	They certainly don't sleep a lot less than we do but they clearly don't sleep more.
166462	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Professor Jerome Siegel found that people in these communities don't go to bed until several hours after sundown - just like us!
176125	But one big difference is that very few of them suffer from <strong>insomnia</strong> - which means having difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.
183680	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, I don't have a problem with insomnia.
186386	And <strong>hunter-gatherers</strong> - people who live by hunting animals and gathering plants to eat - don't either - probably because they take a lot of physical exercise during the day.
195600	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, that's right.
196893	Taking exercise is an important factor in sleeping <strong>soundly</strong> - or well - at night.
202145	But these days our minds can be so active that it becomes very difficult to fall asleep.
207480	Let's listen to Professor Kevin Morgan, from Loughborough University here in England, talking about how cognitive behavioural therapy can be used to help people with insomnia.
217461	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Professor Kevin Morgan, Loughborough University, England<br></strong>If you have a train of thoughts which would otherwise keep you awake one way of dealing with this is to block those thoughts.
225588	What I'd like you to do is repeat the word 'the' in your mind at irregular intervals - the the the the the the the the the - what you'll find (is) that the mind space required to do this blocks out almost everything else.
243482	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So Professor Kevin Morgan suggests saying one word over and over again at irregular intervals - <strong>irregular</strong> in this context means not spaced out evenly.
255082	Doing it can help to block out the thoughts that are stopping you from getting to sleep.
260012	It sounds like a very simple solution.
262439	I wonder if it works?
263410	<strong>Alice<br></strong>There's one way to find out, Neil.
265190	Try it yourself!
266481	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I will.
267170	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK.
267902	And <strong>cognitive behavioural therapy</strong> by the way is a treatment for mental health problems that tries to change the way you think.
274743	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I usually count sheep if I can't get to sleep.
278096	Do you do that, Alice?
278743	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No, not usually.
279997	No.
280846	OK, I think it's time for the answer to our quiz question.
284324	I asked: What's another word for sleepwalking?
288045	Is itâ€¦ a) narcolepsy?
291118	b) restless legs syndrome?
293502	or c) somnambulism?
296089	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said b) restless legs syndrome.
298479	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Sorry, Neil, it's actually c) somnambulism - the roots of this word come from Latin.
305553	<em>Somnus</em> means 'sleep' and and <em>ambulare</em> means 'walk'.
309674	Narcolepsy is a condition where you can't stop yourself falling asleep, especially during the day.
315493	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Narcolepsyâ€¦ (says in a sleepy way)
318322	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And restless legs syndrome is a condition that makes you desperate to move your legs around, especially when you're sitting quietly or trying to get to sleep.
327660	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ get to sleepâ€¦ (murmuring)
329237	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Neil!
335059	Wake up!
336716	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, hello Alice!
337767	Sorry.
338455	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello!
339102	Can we hear today's words again, please?
340759	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, yeah:<br>sleep like a log<br>snoring<br>caffeine<br>insomnia<br>hunter-gatherers<br>soundly<br>irregular<br>cognitive behavioural therapy
360323	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, that just about brings us to the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.
365620	We hope you've enjoyed this programme.
367683	Please do join us again soon.
370227	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.
