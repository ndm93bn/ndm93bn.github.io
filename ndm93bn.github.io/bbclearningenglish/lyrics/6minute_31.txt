1	( Introduction... )
11541	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.
14385	<strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I'm Neil. So Alice, can you think of an example of how the English we speak is changing?
19738	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, I can - teenagers saying 'like' all the time.
23627	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, that's, like, really like annoying, like?
26355	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, the subject of today's show is how and why the English language is changing.
32834	And teenagers definitely have their own code - including text speak when they're on the internet or using their phones.
39568	Fomo, bae, plos - do you have any idea what those terms mean, Neil?
48359	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I've got no idea what you're talking about, Alice.
51041	They're pretty <strong>baffling</strong> - and that means 'hard to understand'.
54478	But that's the idea, isn't it?
56405	We oldies aren't supposed to understand!
58592	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, exactly!
59765	Apparently, 'plos' means 'parents looking over shoulder' - which proves your point!
66824	Text speak is a lot to do with inventing cool new terms - and these change quickly.
72803	In a year, or even six months time, words that were once popular, have disappeared completely.
78562	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, I have a quiz question forming in my mind, Alice - so I hope you're feeling up to the challenge, Alice.
84222	Can you tell me, what kinds of words are slow to change? Is it. <br>a) nouns? <br>b) pronouns? <br>Or c) adjectives?
93458	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I think it's a) nouns.
96395	The way we name things probably doesn't change that quickly.
99611	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We shall find out if you are right or wrong later on in the show.
103744	But let's think about English grammar for a minute, and what changes are occurring here.
108307	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I noticed you said 'shall' there, Neil.
111128	And to my ear, that sounds pretty old fashioned.
113743	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And you're very right, Alice.
114904	The modal verb 'shall' is <strong>on the way out</strong> - meaning it's disappearing.
119270	Why do you think that is?
120501	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, perhaps it's because 'will' sounds more natural these days.
124425	Let's listen to linguist Bas Aarts, talking to writer and presenter, Michael Rosen on the BBC Radio 4 programme <em>Word of Mouth</em>, for his explanation.
133074	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London<br></strong>MR: Why would we lose 'shall'? I mean, if especially as we hold it in the interrogative. We say, you know, 'Shall we go swimming'?
140287	BA: Well, because it's in competition with 'will'.
142180	If you have two words that more or less express the same meaning, one of the two is going to be pushed out of the language.
149084	And in this case, it's 'shall'.
150384	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Bas Aarts there.
152590	And <strong>interrogative</strong> means 'a question'.
154831	So it's not just in nature that we get survival of the fittest - you know, the struggle for life - it happens in language too.
161135	Similar words are competing with each other, and some lose while others <strong>win out</strong> - or succeed after a fight.
167486	Do you know of any other modal verbs that are on their way out, Alice?
171166	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes - 'must' is declining rapidly.
174022	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Why's that?
174916	<strong>Alice<br></strong>'Must' sounds authoritarian, and people are choosing to express <strong>obligation</strong> - or having a duty to do something - in different ways.
183832	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, <strong>authoritarian</strong> means 'demanding that people obey you'.
187265	For example: Alice, you must move on to the next point, now!
192664	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh, you scared me a bit there, Neil!
194742	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. I can see why people are <strong>shying away from</strong> - or avoiding - 'must'.
199397	It sounds nicer to soften obligation by saying things like, 'You <em>might</em> want to move on to the next point now, Alice.'
206630	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK, then, I shall. Let's talk about tenses.
210833	<strong>Progressive</strong> tenses - formed from the verb <em>be</em> and the suffix -<em>ing</em> - are usually used for ongoing situations, for example, 'I'm doing the show with Neil at the moment'.
221538	But its use has been increasing rapidly.
224684	Let's listen to Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts again talking about this.
228666	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London <br></strong>BA: It started increasing dramatically in the 19th century and has continued to rise in the present day.
236387	<br>MR: I think that's a cue for me to say, 'I'm loving it', is that right?
239014	<br>BA: Well, that is one of the constructions that is coming in, I mean, I sometimes call it the Big Mac progressive because of course McDonald's use that.
246642	<strong>Neil<br></strong>In this segment of the BBC Radio 4 programme <em>Word of Mouth</em>, Michael Rosen quotes the progressive form 'I'm loving it' - a slogan used by an American fast-food chain in its advertising campaign.
259729	<strong>Alice<br></strong>The verb 'love' is a <strong>stative</strong> verb.
262353	It expresses a state of being - as opposed to doing - and is traditionally used in the simple form, for example, 'I love it'.
270085	But these days, people are using stative verbs in the progressive more and more.
274961	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I'm hearing what you're saying, Alice!
276947	Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.
280557	I asked you: What kinds of words are slow to change? Is it. <br>a) nouns, b) pronouns or c) adjectives?
287652	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I said a) nouns.
290171	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And you were wrong, Alice!
293318	According to Professor Mark Pagel, evolutionary biologist at Reading University in the UK, pronouns like 'I' and 'you' and 'we' evolve slowly - a thousand years ago we would be using similar or sometimes identical sounds.
307505	Similarly, number words evolve very slowly - our ancestors were using related sounds a thousand or perhaps even two thousand years ago.
315655	Whereas nouns and adjectives get replaced quite rapidly - and in five hundred years or so we'll probably be using different words to the ones we use now.
324699	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, I got that completely wrong then!
327138	Who knew that one, two, three would have such staying power?
330500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I suppose numbers are pretty fundamental to our day-to-day lives - sort of part of who we are.
336282	<strong>Alice<br></strong>OK, let's hear the - hopefully - more permanent words we learned today.
340415	<strong>Neil<br></strong>There were:<br>baffling<br>on the way out<br>interrogative<br>win out<br>obligation<br>authoritarian<br>shying away from<br>progressive<br>stative
356228	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. To recap, we're enjoying the progressive tense.
362335	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And we're loving 'will' and 'should', but avoiding 'shall' and 'must'.
366468	Don't forget to join us again soon!
368546	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye!
