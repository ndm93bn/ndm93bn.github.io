13555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei.
17055	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And I'm Rob. Quick Feifei, shut that door.
20333	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>OK, calm down Rob, what's the problem?
24055	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well there's something going on in the office - everyone's shouting and arguing about who broke the computer - you know, the new one with all that fancy software on it.
32198	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh yes, that really expensive one. So you've run away from the situation - that makes you look very guilty.
40855	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's true - but the problem is, I am guilty.
44888	But the boss seemed so angry, I thought it best to...well...sort of.
49555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Do a runner!
50488	<strong>Rob</strong><br> If you mean to leave a place in order to avoid a difficult or unpleasant situation - then I suppose you're right.
57722	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>I am!
58666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh no, is someone coming? I'll just hide under the desk while we hear some examples of this phrase in action.
67204	<strong>Examples<br></strong>The new trainee did a runner after the first day - I don't think he could cope with the high-pressure environment.
75222	When they started to blame me for the mistake, I felt it best to do a runner and keep out of the way.
84444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So that's the phrase, to do a runner, which means leave a place quickly in order to avoid a difficult or unpleasant situation.
94018	But Rob, this phrase has another similar meaning too?
97933	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. You can 'do a runner' from a place to avoid paying for something.
102499	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Like a restaurant. Have you done that Rob?
105555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Of course not! You know how honest I am.
109008	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Honest? Is that why you are hiding in this studio, rather than admit you broke the new computer?
116096	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, it was an accident. Oh no. the boss is heading straight for the studio. I had better dash...see ya.
123737	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Bye Rob. It looks like he's done a runner...again. Bye.
