13000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Neil.
16066	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And I'm Feifei.
17333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You're a pretty polite person, aren't you, Feifei?
20000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Well, thanks. I don't know. I try to be!
23222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That was a very polite answer! But sometimes we want to say things that are very honest, or that others might not want to hear.
30555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>For example, I ask you: "Do I look tired today?"
35111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I could directly say: "Yes, you do look a bit tired."
40000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Or you could start with this slang expression: 'not gonna lie'.
44458	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Not gonna lie Feifei, you do look a little tired.
47633	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>I know, I need to get to bed earlier! 'Gonna' of course, is short for 'going to'.
53222	Using this phrase indicates that you're choosing to be honest, rather than polite.
58055	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's not only used for honest criticism; we might also use it before something we're very proud of, or something we boast about.
65700	For example: I love recording these programmes. Though I'm not gonna lie, I'm the best presenter in the team.
72144	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Whoah, that's enough. I'm sure everyone listening agrees that I'm the best presenter.
77799	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Of course you're a fantastic presenter, Feifei. Just an example!
81506	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Talking of examples, let's hear a few more.
87777	<strong>Examples<br></strong>A: Fancy coming round for dinner tomorrow?
89777	B: Absolutely.
93388	A: Oh yes. Not gonna lie, it's the best roast in town!\
97888	Slow down! You really are a terrible driver Mark, not gonna lie.
103999	Not gonna lie, I absolutely love my job.
107777	I feel so happy when I walk through the office door every day.
114111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That last example sounds just like me.
116888	Especially as I'm the best presenter.
119999	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>OK, OK, that joke is getting old now.
123299	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You're right. OK, one more thing. This phrase 'not gonna lie'.
127633	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes?
128717	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Not gonna lie, I think some people use it too much!
131666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, it's become a popular phrase on social media.
135073	Usually accompanied by a photo of someone on holiday at the beach with a post saying "Not gonna lie, it's stunning here!"
143952	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The kind of post that makes me feel jealous when I'm stuck in the office.
147777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>But I thought you loved your job?!
149391	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, I do.
150444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And yes, you are a very good presenter, Neil.
153748	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That makes me feel much better, not gonna lie.
156888	<strong>Neil and Feifei<br></strong>Bye.
