18000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And I'm Feifei Feifei Feifei Feifei. What is going on on on on on? It sounds like we're in an echo chamber chamber chamber chamber.
28333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that, Feifei, is our expression in this The English We Speak.
32888	Now, if you say something in an echo chamber, what happens?
36666	<strong>Feifei<br> </strong>You hear the same thing back again again again again.
39911	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. An echo chamber is a room designed to create an echo - usually as an effect in an audio recording or a film.
47888	But it has a modern use which describes a situation where people only hear, see or read opinions they agree with.
56121	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> I see. Just like an echo, they only hear the same thing they've just said.

76999	A: How on earth did SHE win The Z Factor? Literally no one liked her on my social media feed.
86400	B: Yeah well you should try moving away from your echo chamber and listening to people who don't agree with you!
95999	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Echo chamber. A situation in which people only hear their own opinions repeated back to them.
102999	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's often used as a criticism of social media.
106200	Because people choose their friends and follow things they already like, their opinions don't get challenged.
