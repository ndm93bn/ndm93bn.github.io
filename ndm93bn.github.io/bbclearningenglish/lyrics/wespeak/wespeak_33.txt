1	(Introduction...)
13888	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.
17888	<strong>Rob</strong><br>And I'm. Rob.
21358	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>Errr...sorry Rob. What did you say?
24004	<strong>Rob</strong><br>I said, I'm...Rob.
27268	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>Right, and why have you brought a donkey into the studio?
32222	<strong>Rob</strong><br>To help with today's authentic English phrase - which is...donkey's years.
39288	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>So is this about age and how I look like a donkey?
44155	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Not exactly Feifei. The phrase comes from rhyming slang - donkey's years rhymes with donkey's ears, yes?
51777	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>Yes. 'Donkey's years' does rhyme with 'donkey's ears' - so you're saying my ears are like a donkey's?
60191	<strong>Rob</strong><br>No. Unlike your ears, donkey's ears are long and when we say we haven't done something for 'donkey's years' we mean we haven't done something for a long time.
70700	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>Right. Good, so it's got nothing do with me looking like a donkey?
75800	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Absolutely not. Let's hear the phrase in action.
81222	<strong>Examples</strong><br>I'm so bored; I've been doing this job for donkey's years!
86809	I haven't driven a car for donkey's years; I hope I can remember what to do.
91722	We've got to go to Lily's party; I haven't seen her for donkey's years so it'll be great to catch up.
101502	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>That's 'donkey's years' - when we haven't done something for donkey's years, we haven't done it for a very long time.
109153	So Rob, I could say we haven't been to the cinema for donkey's years?
113622	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Yes and you'd be correct. We haven't. Shall we go now?
117177	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>OK. But does your donkey have to come too?
122333	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Oh look, he's very excited!
124666	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>Yuk! I can see. What's that on the floor?
128555	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Ooooh yes! Perhaps we'll leave him shall we, clear that up later.
133505	Perhaps he could present some more programmes while we're away.
137222	<strong>Feifei</strong><br>Ha - that is donkey work! Bye
140111	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Bye.
