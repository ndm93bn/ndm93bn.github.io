11555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.
15255	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.
16000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>In this programme, we're talking about. 'about'!
19081	<strong>Neil<br></strong>About 'about'?
20517	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>About 'about'!
22000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>This is getting silly! We are indeed talking about the word 'about' - but not as it's usually used.
28111	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Indeed. Let's demonstrate. Is Mark about today?
32422	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, I saw him this morning.
34000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So - when I asked: "Is Mark about today?" I wasn't asking if Mark was somehow related to the concept of 'today' I just meant 'Is Mark here'?
42999	<strong>Neil<br></strong>'About' means 'here', or 'somewhere near here'.
46234	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Mark's about. Mark's near here. By the way, who's Mark?
50555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No idea. But I know he's near here!
53033	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Well, that's reassuring. Time for some more examples about 'about'.
59379	<strong>Examples<br></strong>Hi, is Sue about? Just need to give her some files.
64111	Will you be about this evening? I want to ask a big favour.
68333	There's no one about. It's a bit scary.
71999	Don't talk like that. There are children about.
77792	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>There we are. 'About' meaning in or close to an area.
82444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You know, there's another word that behaves like this.
84795	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>You're talking about. 'around'!
86977	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Indeed. We could ask: "Is Mark around?"
89555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And we know the answer to that: you saw him this morning.
92809	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Except. you didn't really see him did you? Because Mark doesn't exist.
97088	<strong>Mark<br></strong>Hi - I'm Mark.
98666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ah, Mark!
100111	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>We were just talking <em>about </em>you!
102447	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We were just talking about 'about'.
104777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And 'around'.
105888	<strong>Neil, Feifei, Mark<br></strong>Bye.
