13444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello I'm Feifei and welcome to The English We Speak - and joining me is Rob.
19444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello everyone.
20666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So Rob, I hear you have a new a hobby?
23155	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes that's right - it's very exciting - let me show you.
28111	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Arghh! Bees! I don't like them - shut the door! So you're new hobby is bee keeping?
35000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes I'm a bee keeper - and I love it - but there is a sting in the tail.
39722	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Of course there's a sting in the tail - bees sting - and it hurts, that's why I don't like bees.
46500	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They only sting when they're angry Feifei - and anyway, when I said 'there's a sting in the tail' I wasn't referring to the bees.
53946	I meant something unpleasant comes with something that is meant to be pleasurable.
58473	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, as I said - looking after bees means you're likely to get stung.
62814	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's true - but what I meant was bee keeping is fun but I wasn't expecting it to cost so much money - I had to buy all these hives and these special protective clothes.
74888	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, you do look silly! So you're saying bee keeping is fun but the unexpected cost of it is the sting in the tail?
83666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Exactly. Let's hear some examples while I go and get some honey.
90444	<strong>Examples<br></strong>We had a great holiday but it had a sting in the tail - when we got home we discovered our house had been broken into.
98111	I love her new book - the story is funny and romantic - but there's a sting in the tail when someone dies.
105461	Yeah, we all got a pay rise this month, but there's a sting in the tail - we're expected to work longer hours.
116666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So that's 'a sting in the tail' - a phrase that means something unpleasant and sometimes unexpected happens when doing something good or fun.
130000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK Feifei, one of the good things about bee keeping is you get this delicious honey - and that's free - go on Feifei, try some.
138070	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hmmm honey, delicious! Oh no, you've brought something else with you...it's a bee!
146500	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Don't panic - I'll try to catch it...ouch! That hurt.
151761	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh dear - it looks like bee keeping has more than one sting in the tail!
156999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Very funny!
158222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Bye!
