12555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello, welcome to The English We Speak, I'm Feifei.
16700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...and hello, I'm Neil. So Feifei, did you enjoy Jane's leaving party last night?
22000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh yeah, it was great. Free food and free drink.
26140	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But that was the only reason was it?
28700	Weren't you sad to see her leave? You've worked with her for many years.
32806	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh...right...yes. Very sad. Such a shame to see her go. We were such good friends.
39880	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Friends! Really? Didn't she tell the boss when you took that extra-long lunch break?
44940	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh yeah - but generally, we were best buddies.
48990	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hmm, and didn't you once punch her when she tried to chat up your boyfriend at the Christmas party?
54202	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>OK, OK, I didn't like her that much.
57850	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well it sounds like you were really her 'frenemy' - someone who pretends to be her friend but is really her enemy.
64998	It's a combination of two words - friend and enemy. Get it?
68888	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Yes, a fren-emy! Hmm, I've never had one of those before.
73666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Really? Well let's hear this word in action.
77700	<strong>Examples<br></strong>She seems so false, I wouldn't trust her - she's just a frenemy.
84304	Tania's been my frenemy for years - I'd go for a quick drink with her but that's it!
89622	Tom's just my frenemy - I pretend to like him but really I can't stand him!
96802	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>If you pretend to be friends with someone but in reality you don't like each other then they are your 'frenemy'.
104522	I wonder if I was <em>her</em> frenemy?
107333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I'm afraid you were. She told me she was only friends with you so she could share your biscuits - and she didn't really like you.
114000	She told me at the party last night.
115700	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Thank goodness we're real friends Neil - at least we can be honest with each other.
121713	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well actually, I don't like you much either.
124988	I only pretend to be your friend when I'm presenting this programme!
128400	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh no! Now I've got two frenemies!
133000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh don't cry Feifei. I was only joking.
