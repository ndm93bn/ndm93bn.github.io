12888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak.
15800	In this programme we have an expression which you can use when you are under a lot of pressure.
20888	I'm Neil and joining me is Feifei.
22944	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello.
23540	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Feifei, if you don't mind me saying, you're looking a little...informal today.
30246	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Well it's true I wouldn't normally come to work in my beachwear but you did warn me about the temperature.
37777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The temperature? To be honest the temperature feels pretty normal in here today and...well, no one else is wearing a bikini.
45999	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So why did you text me to say, 'Just to warn you, the heat is on'?
51666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ahhh I see. I meant that we've got to record and publish the programme by midday - so we're under pressure to get it done.
60666	The expression 'the heat is on' is not actually connected to the temperature. Sorry.
66444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>(embarrassed) Right. OK.
68274	Let's hear some examples while I wrap myself in a towel:
73888	<strong>Examples<br></strong>The deadline's tomorrow and we haven't even started!
78000	The heat's really on now.
80014	The heat is on for United.
83111	If they don't win their last 5 matches they'll lose their place in the Premier League.
89299	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So, 'the heat is on' is an expression you can use to describe a high-pressure situation.
95879	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes and the heat might really be on for you now, Feifei.
99388	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> What do you mean?
100111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, swimwear is against the office dress code. Look out! Here come the BBC fashion police.
106222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Quick - throw me my flip flops and I'll run!
108666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Off you go. Bye!
