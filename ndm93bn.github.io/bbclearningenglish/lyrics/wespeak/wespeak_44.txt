13222	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello and welcome to The English We Speak with me, Feifei and.
17900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>...and me, Rob. Now excuse me Feifei, I just need to reach over and get a tissue before I. SNEEZE! Oh excuse me!
28214	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Are you getting a cold?
31999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh excuse me, I've just got to get this.
35222	<em>Hi mum, I've told you not to call me at work. I'll call you tonight. OK? Bye. </em>Sorry about that.
43666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Err Rob, are you going to do any work?
46766	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Excuse me! I am working very hard to explain today's piece of authentic English.
53299	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Excuse me? Say that again.
55864	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes - that's it - our phrase today is two words with many different meanings - 'excuse me'.
62496	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>I see - so when you sneeze or make a rude noise you can apologise by saying 'excuse me!'
69555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Exactly. And when I wanted you to move so that I could reach for the tissues, I said 'excuse me' to politely ask you to move so that I could reach them. A bit like this.
81444	<strong>Example<br></strong>Excuse me, could you move down the bus please so that I can get on. Thanks!
85711	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>And what about that phone call?
88349	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Ah yes, I said 'excuse me' as a polite way of apologising for the interruption.
94100	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So you were being polite and then you were being rude when you said 'excuse me!'
99555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I was expressing shock and disbelief that you thought I wasn't working. A bit like this.
105190	<strong>Example<br></strong>Excuse me! How can you say I don't do any housework - I cleaned the bathroom yesterday.
110777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And then you said 'excuse me?' because you didn't understand what I said earlier - as usual - and you wanted me to repeat it.
118888	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Excuse me! That's not fair. Any other uses?
123277	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. Here's another one.
124904	<strong>Example<br></strong>Excuse me, do you know the way to the railway station?
127873	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>OK, that's 'excuse me' to get someone's attention.
132130	Well Rob, now I've got <em>your</em> attention, you'll have to 'excuse me' because I've got to go.
138400	<strong>Rob<br></strong>A very good use of 'excuse me' Feifei - politely saying you have to go.So, can you think of any more.?
145982	Feifei? Feifei? Oh she really has gone.
150195	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Bye.
