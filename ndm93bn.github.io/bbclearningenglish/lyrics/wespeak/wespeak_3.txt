16790	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Shh...Let me finish!
18757	Welcome to The English We Speak, the programme where we.

23286	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Ok, ok - you win, Neil. You start the programme.
26900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK - welcome to The English We Speak.
29366	Today we bring you a way to say hello to people that involves...ducks.
34850	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Finally. English is, of course, a rich and diverse language, and different regions use different expressions.
42697	In the English Midlands - the area around the city of Nottingham - you'll hear this.
47855	Imagine I'm in a shop, and Neil is the shopkeeper:
51358	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello duck, how can I help you?
53041	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Hello duck - 'duck' here is a form of address - a word you use when politely speaking to someone.
59926	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And 'duck' is an affectionate term for another person.
63106	So if you hear it - please don't be offended - it's a friendly thing to say.
67200	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Some think that it comes from the word 'duke'!
70479	Let's hear a few examples:
73148	<strong>Examples<br></strong>Come over here and tell me what the problem is, duck.
77375	Don't you worry about that broken glass, duck.
79909	I'll sort it out.
81647	<strong>Neil<br></strong>'Duck' is generally used by people talking to those younger than or the same age as themselves.
87615	In some ways it functions like the word 'dear'.
90649	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>But it's not a phrase that all native English speakers use.
94375	When Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie used it when presenting an award to an English actor from the East Midlands, Jack O'Connoll, it confused a lot of people around the world!
106024	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And what's more, 'duck' is not the only form of address based on animals.
110417	For example, where might someone call you...hen?
114232	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>'Hen' is used in Glasgow - but only when talking to women.
119001	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Alright hen? And then we have 'pet'.
121628	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>'Pet' is used in the North East of England - around Newcastle people call each other 'pet'.
128032	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thanks, pet.
129031	So - listen out for these different regional ways of being friendly - just don't be surprised if you confuse people when you use them yourself!
136454	Thanks for listening.
