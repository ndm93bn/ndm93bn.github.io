12555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Welcome to The English We Speak. I'm Feifei.
15822	<strong>Neil</strong><br> And I'm Neil.
16388	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> And today we're teaching a British slang expression - or maybe just half an expression!
22300	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The phrase is <strong>not half</strong>. Two simple words - but you need to know what they mean when used together.
28333	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Let's try it out first and see if you can work out what it means.
32470	For example, Neil, you really enjoyed that pizza, didn't you?
36499	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Not half</strong>! I love pizza.
38689	And Feifei, you love playing darts, don't you?
41555	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Darts, <strong>not half</strong>! I play every night.
45492	So - what does <strong>not half</strong> mean? It means 'very much' in these answers.
50777	When I replied "<strong>not half</strong>" I meant: 'Yes, very much.' I really like darts.
56000	<strong>Neil</strong><br> And do you?
56801	<strong>Feifei</strong><br> What?
57500	<strong>Neil</strong><br> Like darts?
58777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Erm, that's not the point. I'm trying to give an example.
61950	<strong>Neil</strong><br> For the record, I do love pizza.
67555	<strong>Examples<br></strong>A: That party was awesome!
70444	B: <strong>Not half</strong>, mate. The music was incredible.
73555	A: <strong>Not half</strong> is a useful phrase, huh?
76000	B: <strong>Not half</strong>.
79888	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Ahh, that was a funny example. Now, before we go - let's teach a variation of this phrase.
87222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>In this version, we have <strong>not half</strong> followed by an adjective.
90999	For example: I just got back from Singapore. It's <strong>not half</strong> expensive.
95166	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>So - that means it's very expensive! <strong>Not half</strong> expensive.
99555	Similarly, if I were to say: "Your new haircut's <strong>not half</strong> nice, Neil!
104666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You would be saying my haircut is very nice. Was that just another example?
109444	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh no, I meant it.
110900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Too kind.
111777	<strong>Feifei<br></strong> So there we are - <strong>not half</strong> meaning 'very much'.
115111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>not half</strong> with an adjective.
117000	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>See you next time.
118000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Bye.
