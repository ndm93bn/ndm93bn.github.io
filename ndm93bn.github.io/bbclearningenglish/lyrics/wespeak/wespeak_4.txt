1	(Introduction...)
12666	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Plates. OK. Spoons...all packed.
17279	That's one box full. The kitchen is finished, Neil!
20701	<strong>Neil<br></strong>All packed? Well done.
22509	Now let's move on to the bedroom.
24573	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>OK. I'm exhausted.
27374	In today's The English We Speak, Neil and I are moving house, and there's just so much packing to do.
34354	The house is full of cardboard boxes!
37182	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I know, I know Feifei.
39046	Listen, let's just finish this room and then we can sit down, relax and see what's on the box.
44514	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Neil, the last thing I want to do is look at any more boxes! I need a break.
49903	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, of course. What I meant was: see what's on TV!
54597	'On the box' is a slang expression meaning 'on TV'.
58549	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Ok, why didn't you just say 'on TV'?!
62304	Anyway, let's play some examples while we finish packing.
65858	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Good idea.
67700	<strong>Examples<br></strong>A: See anything good on the box last night?
69668	B: Yeah! There was this great new series about spies.
75418	A: What are you up to tonight?
77183	B: Not much, just gonna relax in front of the box.
81900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes - you can also relax 'in front of the box', which means in front of the television.
87042	And which reminds me, Feifei: where is the box, I mean, our TV?
91943	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Oh, oh yes. I, err...packed it away already.
97136	But I don't remember which box I put it in.
99791	<strong>Neil<br></strong>You mean the box, is in...a box?
102547	But we've packed 20 boxes already. Which one is it in?
105764	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Sorry!
106701	Let's just finish packing and then go out for dinner.
109108	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, I've had enough of these boxes too, bye.
112262	<strong>Feifei<br></strong>Bye!
