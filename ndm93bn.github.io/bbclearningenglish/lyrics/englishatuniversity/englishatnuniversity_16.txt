6249	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Hello. It's that time for English at University â€“ the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.
20613	The first term has finished and the Christmas holidays are about to begin.
24495	The students at the University of Studies are busy preparing to go homeâ€¦ except for oneâ€¦
31374	<strong>Abi<br></strong>Oh I can't wait for my boyfriend to pick me up â€“ it's going to be great just hanging around, doing nothing for three weeks â€“ a bit like here really.
41901	Oh, are you not packing your bags Mary â€“ you've got a long journey home haven't you?
46989	<strong>Mary</strong><br> No. I haven't. I left it too late to book a flight home and now they're all sold out.
53174	<strong>Abi</strong><br> No! Well what are you going to do?
56540	It's Christmas, you can't spend it on your own.
60228	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Don't worry. I'm allowed to stay here â€“ and I can do some reading and studying and watch TV â€“ anyway, I don't really do the <strong>festive</strong> thingâ€¦
72222	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Only me. Hi Maryâ€¦ Abiâ€¦ so you heard about my feedback from Professor Not then?
78809	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Yes. It wasn't great was itâ€¦
81998	<strong>Abi<br> </strong>Don't worry about that â€“ they only say bad things to make you work harder.
87443	Anyway, Danny boy, what are doing for the <strong>Yuletide</strong> period?
91477	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Going home to my Mum and Dad's of course...boring.
94910	I'm catching the train at two o'clock so though I'd come and say 'Happy Christmas'.
99439	<strong>Abi<br></strong>Hold on! You've got a spare bed at your parents' house, haven't you?
104549	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Err yeah.
106263	<strong>Abi</strong><br> Perfect! Mary can't get a flight home for Christmas so she can go and stay at yours, can't she?!
113323	<strong>Daniel<br> </strong>What? Really? Do you really want to come and stay with meâ€¦ at Christmas?
118440	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Well, with your parents â€“ if it's not too much trouble.
122492	<strong>Daniel<br> </strong>Ace! I'll go and ring my Mum.
124956	<strong>Abi<br></strong>There you go Mary. Christmas is sorted â€“ have a good one.
131265	<strong>Mum<br> </strong>Oh Mary it's so nice to meet you. Daniel's never brought a girl home before.
137464	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Let's change the subject. Fancy pulling a <strong>cracker</strong> mum?
141653	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Mary, it's time to be polite, say how grateful you are but set the record straight â€“ explain â€“ about you and Daniel.
149247	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, of course. Err, Mrs Smytheâ€¦ I'm very touched that you've allowed me to stay with you.
156418	I'm really grateful to have somewhere to stay. You're such nice people to spend the holidays with.
161850	<strong>Mum<br></strong>Ooo Jim, doesn't she say such nice things. Daniel's really found a treasure here.
169413	<strong>Daniel<br> </strong>Mum!
170407	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Thank you. I'm very pleased to have Daniel as a good friend but I think there's been some confusion.
176965	Can I just make it clearâ€¦ we're not together.
179856	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>No mum, we're not 'an item'. Just friends, like she said.
184882	<strong>Mum<br> </strong>Oh rightâ€¦ no wedding yet then. Ah well, you're still a lovely girl.
191121	Would you like to carve the <strong>turkey</strong>?
198241	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Mrs Smythe seems to like you Mary.

210058	<strong>You're such nice people to spend the holidays with.
213256	You also told Daniel's mum you're not mad enough to be going out with her son!
218525	Here are some of the things you said to clear up any confusionâ€¦

249971	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Hello!
251249	<strong>Prof. Not<br> </strong>Yes hello. A bit of a surprise I know.
254483	It's justâ€¦ I tried to find Mary at the university but Abi said she'd come hereâ€¦ ah Maryâ€¦ I wanted to say sorry for the confusion in our meeting last week and give you a Christmas <strong>present</strong>â€¦ so err, here you areâ€¦
272658	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Goshâ€¦ thanks.
274461	<strong>Mum<br> </strong>Actually, me and Jim have bought you a little something too.
279324	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>And I've just made some <strong>mince pies</strong> to eat â€“ but go on Mary, open your presents first.
286245	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh right. This is so kind of you all.
296749	Oh lovely Mr and Mrs Smythe, a woolly scarf and mittens â€“ very useful.
308004	Oh wow! Professor, a book.
311524	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Yes, it's my latest book 'Funny Business' â€“ look I've signed it for you.
315910	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Thanks!
318404	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Well as we're doing presents, you might as well open mine nowâ€¦ here you are.
325932	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Goodnessâ€¦ it's a small boxâ€¦ a lovely bow.
335768	It's a memory stick â€“ with <em>my </em>name on it! That's brilliant â€“ just what I wanted.
342691	Oh everybody, despite being a long way from home, it's been great being here â€“ a real home from home.
349516	<strong>Everyone</strong><br><strong>Happy Christmas!
353801	<strong>Mum<br></strong>So professor, Sharon would you like to stay for dinner?
358451	<strong>Both<br></strong>Oh yes please.
