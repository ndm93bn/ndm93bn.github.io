6000	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Hello. It's time for English at University â€“ we're following Mary through her first year of study abroad and helping her and you learn some useful phrases.
20603	University life is not <strong>all work and no play</strong> â€“ it's about having fun too and today Mary needs some persuading to <strong>let her hair down</strong> â€“ you know, relax and enjoy herself with some extracurricular activities.
33877	And someone who knows most about doing that is her roommate Abiâ€¦ &nbsp;
40934	<strong>Abi</strong><br> Still studying Mary? You look glued to that desk.
44907	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, I think I am. I'm just writing up my notes and then I've got to read Professor Not's new bookâ€¦ and then Iâ€™ve got toâ€¦
53743	<strong>Abi<br></strong>Blah blah blah! I don't know what you're saying.
57484	It really is time to <strong>chillax</strong>â€¦ have a break.
61767	Come onâ€¦ you're coming with me.
67187	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Phew! It's hot in here. Oh hello Professor and hello Sharon.
74226	<strong>Prof. Not and Sharon<br></strong>Hello, Mary.
75811	<strong>Abi<br></strong>Now, this is Bikram yoga â€“ it'll keep you fit and help you lose weight.
82291	And that guy over there's quite fit too!
86008	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>I've lost a kilo in a month haven't I Robertâ€¦ I mean-?
91288	<strong>Prof. Not</strong><br> Err - yes. It improves your mind too Mary.
96542	<strong>Yoga teacher<br></strong>Welcome everyone. Let's begin.
99866	Just follow meâ€¦ first of all, stand straight and breathe deeplyâ€¦ inâ€¦ outâ€¦ hold it thereâ€¦ goodâ€¦ next stretch your arms out, then slowly bend to touch your toes.
119757	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Oh noâ€¦ I seemed to have pulled something in my back.
124344	Sharon, could you give me a handâ€¦
127690	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Oh - you've gone a funny colour. Oh, he's so heavy.
133020	Abi, could you give me a hand? Mary, can you call for help?
138702	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes of courseâ€¦ oh what should I do?
141891	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>You need to call the medical centre and tell them there's an emergency.
145825	Explain what's happened and ask for someone to come and help 'asap' â€“ as soon as possible.
152070	Go on Mary, get calling!
154003	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Right ok. Yes hello.
159773	Is that the medical centre?
161837	Good. We have an emergency in the yoga classâ€¦ in the sports hall.
165980	Professor Not has hurt his back and he needs help.
169091	Yes, he bent over and couldn't stand up againâ€¦ I'll ask him.
173447	She says "Does it hurt?"
175523	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Oww. Yes! When are they coming?
178024	<strong>Mary<br></strong>He says "Yes". How long do you think you'll be?
181669	Really? Please could you come as soon as possible?
184747	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Ask them what we should do until they get here.
187871	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Right, yesâ€¦ Is there anything we can do before you arrive?
192090	Yes, aha, right. I'll do that.
195194	Thank you. Bye.
197519	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>What did they say?
199908	<strong>Mary<br></strong>They said <strong>"chill out"</strong>&nbsp;â€“ whatever that means!
210373	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Goodness. What a drama!
212528	It looks like Professor Not's attempt to unwind has gone too far - but luckily, help is on its way thanks to these phrases that Mary usedâ€¦
221167	<strong>We have an emergency in the yoga class. We need help.
225277	<strong>How long do you think you'll be?
