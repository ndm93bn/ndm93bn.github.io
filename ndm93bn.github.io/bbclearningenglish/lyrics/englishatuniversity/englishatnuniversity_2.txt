98724	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Me too! <strong>I don't suppose you could show me the way, could you?
103370	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>â€¦ I don't know why I'm studying there though.
105034	I should have gone to Oxford or Cambridgeâ€¦ I did so well in my A levelsâ€¦ but I suppose I can share my 'wisdom' with the other undergraduatesâ€¦ anywayâ€¦
