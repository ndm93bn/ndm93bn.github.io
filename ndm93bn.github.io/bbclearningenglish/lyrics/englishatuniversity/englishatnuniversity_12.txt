5818	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Hello. It's time again for English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.
18585	Mary's been set some work â€“ to write an assignment about business.
22924	Always <strong>studious</strong> and keen to do well, she's getting on with it in the peace and quiet of the library.
32680	<strong>Mary<br></strong>â€¦so good business needs a good plan. Hmmm.
38531	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Oh hi Mary. <strong>Beavering away?</strong>
41704	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Hello Daniel. Well we have got an assignment to write.
46046	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Yeah but we've still got three days and I work best when the pressure's on.
49917	Blimey, your laptop's a bit ancient isn't it?
53106	<strong>Mary</strong><br> It's a new one actually and it does me just fine.
56589	Look at what I've done so farâ€¦ oh no! It's frozen.
61575	If I push the arrow here nothing moves. Oh dear and I haven't saved it yet.
68492	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Proved my point eh?
69746	I've got one of those Macpad Fabs â€“ brilliant â€“ fast processor, huge memory, almost does the assignment for you.
77520	Anyway, look what you've got to do is just reboot â€“ press this button hereâ€¦ wait a few seconds and â€¦.
85045	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Nothing. Everything's disappeared! Daniel, what have you done?
90702	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>What has he done indeed? Idiot!
94010	You've been so <strong>diligent</strong> â€“ you've worked hard â€“ to get this assignment done, I think you're going to need some help to get it back.
101015	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I know. But I know nothing about technology, what questions should I ask?
106955	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Don't panic. You need to find someone who knows a bit about technology and say 'I seem to have lost my work, what can I do?'
114826	or 'do you think you can restore my work please?'
117986	or say 'I turned my computer off and didn't back up my work, is there anything you can do?' â€“ even if it was Daniel's fault.
125944	Go and see if you can get some help.
127595	<strong>Mary<br></strong>OK, I will. Oh look, there's that technology student over there. I'll ask him.
134717	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>I don't think he's going to know what to doâ€¦
136662	<strong>Mary<br></strong>â€¦excuse me. Do you remember me from the Study Skills session?
140749	<strong>Tech Student<br></strong>Oh, yes I do. I never forget anyone who uses an Acorn Fastbook 5.4 laptop.
147873	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, good. Well I've got a problemâ€¦ Daniel has turned off my laptop and I seem to have lost my work, what can I do?
157261	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>I was just trying to reboot it.
159233	<strong>Tech Student<br></strong>Hmm. That's a silly thing to do. Let me have a look.
162514	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Thanks. Do you think you can restore my work?
165716	<strong>Tech Student<br></strong>Did you back up your work?
167520	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Err well no, not before Iâ€¦ I mean Daniel, switched it off.
172810	Is there anything you can do?
175219	<strong>Tech Student<br></strong>Oh dear. Well if I do thisâ€¦ ah there bingo!
180967	Luckily it was saved on the laptop memory. An impressive 24 gigabytes of RAM in fact.
187685	I'd advise you to back it up onto this memory stick.
190682	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>It's alright mate, she can use mine.
192680	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Thanks so much err?
195288	<strong>Tech Student<br></strong>Malcolm. You're welcome.
197143	How about having a drink tonight?
199500	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Sorry I can't. I've got to study.
206432	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well done Malcolm and well done Mary for asking for help.
210304	You got yourself out of a tricky situation by asking these questionsâ€¦
214357	<strong>I seem to have lost my work, what can I do?
217951	<strong>Do you think you can restore my work please?
221007	<strong>Is there anything you do?

233385	So two days later, and Mary has been working <strong>in earnest</strong> to complete her assignment and now she's finished, it looks like somebody else needs some helpâ€¦
242676	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Mary, Maryâ€¦ my laptop's broken and I haven't even started my assignment!
248087	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Your 'Macpad Fab'?
249715	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Yeah. Don't know what's happened but it won't turn on.
252262	I couldn't borrow yours could Iâ€¦ and that memory stick I lent you?
256280	<strong>Mary<br></strong>OK - just to help a friend. But look after it and remember to back up your work!
261492	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Yeah of course. Why wouldn't I? You sure you won't need it tonight?
265915	<strong>Mary<br></strong>No, sure go ahead. I'm going for a drink with Malcolm tonight.
