6083	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Hello and welcome to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.
19234	New student Mary is settling into university life but still hasn't visited the most important place you'll need to go to, to help you with your studies.
29067	It's a great place for a <strong>bookworm</strong> like Mary â€“ it's the library.
35016	So Mary, have you got your library card with you?
38568	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, I've got it thanks.
40834	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>And your reading list â€“ the list of books you need to read for this year's course?
45894	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I've got it hereâ€¦ I just need to find the books now.
51264	Ah, here I am now â€“ The Library.
56988	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Nextâ€¦
58904	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Sharon! Do you work here <em>as well</em>?
61866	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Yes, we tend to double up round here.
65351	It's the funding cuts â€“ the university's not got that much money â€“ anyway dear, I suppose you're looking for some books?
73900	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, that's right. Where can I find books about business please?
78904	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Down there, turn left, then right, then to the endâ€¦ under 'B'â€¦ B for biologyâ€¦
86326	<strong>Mary<br></strong>and 'Business'. Thanks.
93298	Oh noâ€¦ oh dearâ€¦ none of the books I need are here!
98835	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear Mary.
101137	A <strong>bibliophile</strong> like you â€“ someone who loves reading - needs to get to the library early if you want to get the books you need - but don't worry, I'm sure you can reserve them.
111207	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Reserve them? But what do I say?
114356	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Go and ask Sharon to check if she has your books in stock â€“ and if not ask if she can reserve them for you â€“ and see if she can put them by for youâ€¦ that means keep them for a period of time until you can collect themâ€¦
127526	<strong>Mary<br></strong>OK, I'll do just that. Thanks.
131641	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Next! Oh it's you againâ€¦ any luck?
137084	<strong>Mary<br></strong>No, I'm afraid not. I can't find anything.
141243	Please could you check if you have any of these in stock.
147146	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Noâ€¦ noâ€¦ no. Sorry, no.
156728	It looks like a DANIEL SMYTHE has them all out at the moment.
163225	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh dear. Well, perhaps you could reserve them for me please?
167870	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Of course dear.
169476	<strong>Mary<br></strong>OK. So could you put them by for me when they come in please?
174426	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Certainly dear. We'll send you an email when they're back in.
178682	<strong>Mary<br></strong>â€¦and when do you think they will be available?
181448	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Let's have a lookâ€¦ three weeks' time.
185771	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Three weeks? That's too late! I need them for my studies.

246269	<strong>Abi<br></strong>Oh hi Mary. Something on your mind?
249795	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Yes, all the text books I need have been taken out of the library.
253827	<strong>Abi<br></strong>Oh never mind, there's never time to read those <em>boring</em> books anywayâ€¦ but hold onâ€¦ I think I did buy some of them when I was in the first yearâ€¦ let's have a lookâ€¦ there, how about this one?
