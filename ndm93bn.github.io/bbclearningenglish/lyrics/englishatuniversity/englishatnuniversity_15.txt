5851	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Welcome back to English at University â€“ the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year at university.
18501	It's almost the end of Mary's first term at the University of Studies.
22495	She's settled in well and made some new friends but today's the day to find out how well her studying's going when she gets some feedback from Professor Not.
33678	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Hello Mary. Take a seatâ€¦ no, I mean sit down.
38078	So let's review your progress this term. How's it been?
42844	<strong>Mary</strong><br> I think it's beenâ€¦
47706	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Sorry to interrupt.
50327	There's your teaâ€¦ biscuitsâ€¦ I got you those chocolate ones you like â€¦ and the files you asked forâ€¦ and I got those tickets for the show tonight OK?
62813	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Err. Thank you Sharon. Could you errrâ€¦ file those away for me please?
68060	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Righty-ho.
69600	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Now where was I? Ah yes â€“ your term so far. How's it been?
75288	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Well. Very goodâ€¦ I think. I was a little homesick but everyone's been so supportive, especially Sharon.
83287	<strong>Prof. Not</strong> Oh yes, <strong>I concur</strong>, she's a real brick!
86514	Well that's good to hear.
87762	I know you've had to adapt to our strange British waysâ€¦ and that might explain some of these notes I've written about you.
96549	Work â€“ average, needs to work on expressing ideas more clearlyâ€¦ I'm a bit concerned about progress, maybe a little wet behind the earsâ€¦ goodness, did I really write that?
110067	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> <strong>I beg to differ</strong> Mary â€“ I mean I don't agree. He can't be talking about you!
115407	I think you need to offer some feedback on his feedback and get him <strong>to see eye-to-eye</strong> with you.
121047	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I can't do that. He's the professor.
123756	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>He may be in charge but he's not always right.
126819	You are entitled to say 'I find your comments &nbsp;a bit harsh', 'I feel I have put in 100 per cent effort this term' and 'what evidence do you have for your feedback?'.
137086	Try that and make it clear you think he's wrong â€“ but be polite.
140944	<strong>Mary<br></strong>It won't be easy but I'll try. Professor Notâ€¦ I like you.
149533	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Oh thank you.
150721	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I mean you are a good teacher and have been very helpful.
154119	As you know I feel I have put in 100 per cent effort this termâ€¦
158810	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong><strong>I couldn't agree more</strong>.
160412	<strong>Mary<br></strong>So I find your comments a bit harsh and a little unfair.
164472	I mean, what evidence do you have for your feedback?
167638	<strong>Prof. Not<br></strong>Err wellâ€¦ let's look at the mark for your assignmentâ€¦ shall we?
175197	It says here D minus. Hmm, is that right?
180416	<strong>Mary<br></strong>D minus! No it can't beâ€¦ I worked so hardâ€¦ andâ€¦
189338	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Sorry, more biscuitsâ€¦ what's going on and why is Mary crying?
195770	Robert, what have you done? Come on Mary, I'll make you a nice cup of tea.
207200	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear. This feedback session hasn't gone to plan.
210910	Giving feedback is supposed to be a positive and useful experience but Professor Not seems to have gone too far by using these phrasesâ€¦
219467	<strong>Work is average.
221828	<strong>Needs to work on expressing ideas more clearly.
225411	<strong>I'm a bit concerned about your progress.
228266	<strong>A little wet behind the ears.
230548	But Mary stood her ground with these phrasesâ€¦
233627	<strong>I feel I have put in 100 per cent effort this term.
237239	<strong>I find your comments a bit harsh.
239972	<strong>What evidence do you have for your feedback?

253442	Now, let's hope Sharon can explain Professor Not's comments and make him see sense.
259142	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>There's your tea. I know Robert.
263065	I mean Professor Not had a late night last night, maybe he got confused?
269436	Can you not just <strong>agree to disagree</strong>?
272072	Now let's have a look at these filesâ€¦ oh dearâ€¦
277781	<strong>Mary<br></strong>What is it Sharon?
279630	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>I seem to have given him the wrong file.
283351	He was reading the comments he'd written for Daniel Smythe. Ooopps.
290155	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Hello you two. Time for my feedback session with the old Prof.
295432	Can't wait to hear all the great things he's got to say about me. It's been such a brilliant term.
300915	<strong>Sharon</strong><br> Errrâ€¦ you'd better go in.
