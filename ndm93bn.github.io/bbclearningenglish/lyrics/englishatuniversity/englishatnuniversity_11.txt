1	(Introduction...)
5607	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Hello. It's time for English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.
19229	There's a lot to learn when you start studying for a degree and especially when you're doing it in another country.
24994	Mary's coping very well and is making the most of every opportunity to get <strong>guidance</strong> or help her with her studies.
31562	Today she's attending Professor Not's study skills workshop but it sounds like she knows more about studying than he does!
40603	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>â€¦so let's just stand around in a circleâ€¦ hold hands and say mmmmm.
50907	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>How exactly is this helping?
53292	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>Trust you to spoil the karma. It just helps us thinkâ€¦
57105	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Think of what to say, you mean.
58882	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>Now to study well, you need to be in the right zone.
63856	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Zone?
64689	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>In the right placeâ€¦ in your head. Sharonâ€¦
68760	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Yes Robert - I mean, Professor.
72293	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>Could you hand out the blindfolds?
74680	<strong>Mary<br></strong>And how are they going to help?
77398	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>A good question Mary.
79125	I admire Professor Not's enthusiasm but let <strong>me give you a bit of advice</strong> â€“ his study skills are a bit 'alternative' - different.
87758	Have you got any advice to offer?
89648	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Well, I did read a book about good study skills on the plane.
93761	But what do I say?
95354	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Say 'could I offer some suggestions?'
98037	or 'from what I understandâ€¦' or maybe, 'something that works for me isâ€¦' and give them your tips â€“ that way you won't sound too big-headed â€“ like someone we know!
109430	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Maybe we could just hold the hand of the person next to us?
113111	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Go on Mary.
114413	<strong>Mary<br></strong>No Danielâ€¦ maybe I could offer some suggestions?
118721	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Oh yes Mary!
120333	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Wellâ€¦ from what I understandâ€¦ you must study every dayâ€¦ and choose a regular place and time to do it.
128486	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>Yes of course, very good Mary. Anything else?
131978	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Wellâ€¦ what works for me is planning my time and deciding what I want to achieveâ€¦ and not being afraid to ask for help.
141228	<strong>Daniel</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. I was going to say that â€“ and make sure you take lots of breaks â€“ long ones.
146466	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Short ones â€“ and develop a good learning style â€“ choose a method that helps you learn best.
153585	<strong>Prof.Not</strong><br> Excellent Mary. That's exactly right.
158465	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Oh, I preferred the blindfold method.
165204	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Excellent indeed Mary. She's on fire!
168383	She spoke up and gave some <strong>sage advice</strong> without showing off.
172468	Here's a reminder of how she started the conversationâ€¦
175747	<strong>Maybe I could offer some suggestions?
178839	<strong>From what I understandâ€¦</strong>
181124	<strong>What works for me isâ€¦</strong>
183072	And she gave some good advice which the other students â€“ especially Daniel - will no doubt find very useful, such asâ€¦
191301	<strong>You must study every day</strong>
193508	<strong>Choose a place and time to do it</strong>
196048	<strong>Plan your time and decide what you want to achieve</strong>
199630	<strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help</strong>
201830	<strong>Choose a learning style that helps you learn best</strong>
206302	With that advice you can't go wrong.
208888	And now it looks like Mary's study advice has made a real impression on someoneâ€¦
215182	<strong>Tech Student</strong><br> Wow Mary.
216249	I loved what you said in there â€“ really useful â€“ I can see you're a committed student â€“ how about getting together sometime andâ€¦ comparing study notes?
225168	<strong>Mary</strong><br> Well, errr, ermmâ€¦
227166	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>I think she's quite busy at the moment.
229076	<strong>Mary<br></strong>No, I'm not â€“ that would be lovely. Let's meet up in the bar later.
234252	<strong>Sharon</strong><br> Ooooh!
