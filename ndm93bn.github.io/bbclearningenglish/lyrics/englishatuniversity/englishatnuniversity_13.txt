149	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome back to English at University where we're following Mary's first year of study abroad and helping with some useful words and phrases.
15162	The new Business Studies students have been busy working on their first assignment and now the deadline is approaching to hand them in.
22641	Will they all complete their work on time? I'm sure you have Mary!
28619	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Me? Yes. Once I got my laptop problem fixed I saved my work onto that memory stick...oh no!
36458	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>What's wrong?
37976	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Daniel's got the memory stick. I must go and find him.
41136	<strong>Narrator<br> </strong>Good luck!
43888	<strong>Prof.Not</strong><br> Hello Mary! Looking forward to reading that assignment of yours.
47463	Don't forget to email me by the end of the day.
50305	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Yes...yes of course you'll get it tonight.
54027	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>Good. Don't forget it counts towards 20 per cent of your final exam mark. See you later.
59901	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Really! Now where is Daniel when you need him?
64241	<strong>Narrator<br> </strong>Yes, where is he? If you can't find him you're going to miss the deadline â€“ may I suggest you ask for an extension.
71119	An extra period of time to get your work finished.
74273	You need to apologise to Sharon and say 'I'm having problems meeting the deadline for my assignment' and try to <strong>talk her round</strong> so that she gives you a bit more time.
84528	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>But I've done my work.
86342	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> We know that - but you haven't got it with you to hand in.
89721	So make sure you explain everything to Sharon and <strong>reassure</strong> her you'll get it sorted â€“ but remember you don't get extensions for any old reason.
98214	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Ok thanks. I'll go and see her now.
105105	<strong>Sharon </strong><br> Oh cheeky. Well we'll do it again if you.
111457	oh hello Mary. I'll call you back. How are things?
118171	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Good, ok, bad really. I can't find Daniel.
124065	he's got my assignment...wellâ€¦ it's saved on his memory stick.
127390	<strong>Sharon</strong><br> Left it in his room did you?
129551	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>No! Nothing like that.
131947	I've got to email it to Professor Not today and I can't find it...so I was wondering.
139559	well, 'I'm having problems meeting the deadline for my assignmentâ€¦ so is it possible to get an extension for my assignment - please?
149150	<strong>Sharon<br> </strong>We can't hand out extensions willy-nilly.
153983	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>I have a very good reason for asking. I mean, it's written, it's just I can't find it.
159533	<strong>Sharon<br> </strong>Hmmm.
160728	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>If I could have just one more day before I hand it in, I'd be most grateful?
165166	It won't happen again. Please?
168088	<strong>Sharon<br> </strong>Look, I'm seeing Robert.
171017	I mean Professor Notâ€¦ this evening to go over some documents.
175960	and I could put in a good word for you.
179706	that means say you're hard working, normally reliable and you won't do it again. OK?
187380	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Sharon, you are amazing!
190624	<strong>Sharon<br> </strong>Ooo, nobody's ever called me that before!
198643	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Phew! It looks like Mary has managed to <strong>sweet talk</strong> Sharon into getting a deadline extension â€“ but she had to be polite and humble.
206658	Here's a reminder of some of the phrases she usedâ€¦

245284	<strong>Daniel<br> </strong>Ah Mary, there you are â€“ I've been looking all over the place for you.
249860	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Me too! I need that memory stick â€“ it's got my assignment saved on it.
254917	Daniel â€“ I had to go and ask Sharon for extra time to hand it in.
258545	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>You managed to <strong>win her over</strong> did you!
260541	Well don't worry, I've got it here in myâ€¦ myâ€¦ oh noâ€¦ it's goneâ€¦ I must have dropped it.
