6350	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> It's time for English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.
19212	Mary's had her first Business Studies lecture and now she's decided to go to Professor Not's evening seminar - that's when a group of students meet with their teacher to discuss what they've learnt.
30885	But the problem is there's always <strong>a chatterbox</strong> - you know, someone who likes to do <em>all</em> the talking.
38797	<strong>Prof Not<br></strong>So glad you could make my seminar Mary.
42063	although I don't know where everyone else is... maybe it's the rain.
45467	<strong>Mary<br></strong>... well, it is quite wet out there.
47560	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>... there you go Robert - red wine for you and - oh, hello... it's Mary isn't it?
54313	<strong>Mary<br></strong>What are you doing here - I thought you just did administration?
59233	<strong>Sharon</strong><br> I do... but Robert, I mean Professor Not, likes help with his spreadsheets and photocopying and stuff.
67586	<strong>Prof Not </strong><br> Yes, I give you a lift home after the seminar - as you live round the corner from me.
74547	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh right, I didn't know.
78121	<strong>Sharon</strong><br> ... anyway, don't mind me.
80327	I'll just sit here while you chat about clever things like business - is it just you tonight Mary?
88742	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>I'm not too late am I... you did say eight o'clock?
92333	<strong>Prof Not</strong> <br> Yes I did - come and sit down.
94990	no, not on my books... just there.
97815	Have you met Sharon?
99404	<strong>Sharon</strong><br> Hello!
100181	<strong>Prof Not</strong><br> So, let's begin shall we.
102665	Now I talked about business being an economic system, but what do we mean by 'system'?
109982	<strong>Mary</strong><br> I think.
110657	<strong>Daniel</strong><br> Well, obviously a system is a thing... you know.
114662	<strong>Mary</strong><br> But.
115276	<strong>Daniel</strong><br> And 'economic' is about... the economy. Yeah?
119587	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Daniel - <strong>put a sock in it</strong>!
121973	You can't <strong>get a word in edgeways</strong> with him around.
124823	Mary, don't let him dominate the conversation - he needs to <strong>pipe down</strong> and you need to speak up - be polite but firm and say you want a chance to speak.
135372	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh right, if I must. Daniel - would you mind if I had a chance to speak please?
144465	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Oh right... yeah, of course.
147082	I was just explaining that economics is.
149526	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>I know... but I would like to say something too, if you don't mind.
154849	<strong>Prof Not<br></strong>Exactly. I think Mary should give us her views - so Daniel... <strong>zip it</strong>... please.
160485	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Thank you for giving me the chance to speak.
162810	I'd like to contribute to the discussion and say that to be in business you need something to sell.
170369	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Oh, that's very good Mary.
176156	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Excellent Mary - very impressive.
178985	Once Daniel stopped <strong>talking your ears off</strong>, you finally got a chance to express yourself with the help of these useful phrases.
186485	<strong>Would you mind if I had a chance to speak please?</strong>
190200	<strong>I would like to say something too, if you don't mind.
194094	<strong>Thank you for giving me the chance to speak.</strong>

211792	Now, how's Professor Not's seminar going?
215101	<strong>Prof Not</strong><br> ...so I think you'll find some useful stuff in my book 'Mind Your Own Business' - but we'll call it a day for now - I'll see you at my next lecture.
224112	<strong>Mary/Daniel<br></strong>Oh yes... thank you... it's all very interesting.
228792	<strong>Sharon<br></strong>Oh look at the rain out there - it's pouring.
233512	Still giving me a lift home Robert, hmmm?
236624	<strong>Prof Not<br></strong>Yes, yes, of course - maybe I could drop you off on the way home too Mary?
242264	<strong>Mary<br></strong>If it's not too much trouble.
244964	<strong>Prof Not<br></strong>Of course not Mary.
246308	But sorry Daniel, it's quite a small car so I don't think we'll fit you in.
250654	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Oh, oh ok. I like walking.
