5991	<strong>Narrator</strong><br> Hello and welcome to English at University - the series that teaches some English phrases to help you through your first year of study abroad.
21007	Mary's come to the UK to study Business at the University of Studies â€“ she's learning about student life but she hasn't learnt much about business yet â€“ however she's about to go to her second lecture, so all that might changeâ€¦.
35720	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>â€¦so business really is the life blood of the economy â€“ and we can read more about that in my book.
43379	Anyway, the subject of your first assignmentâ€¦
47013	<strong>Mary<br></strong>What's an assignment?
48738	<strong>Daniel <br> </strong>It's a piece of work- like an essay â€“ you have to do as part of your studies.
54548	I love assignments: I'm always very good at them.
57923	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>â€¦Daniel, can you pay attention please.
60135	This is very important â€“ your assignment can be quite short or very long and it's about business and what-not.
68843	Type it out and send it to me â€“ easy really.
71759	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear. It's <strong>easier said than done</strong>.
75007	He's not very clear about what he wants. Are you confused Mary?
79080	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I am a bit. Quite short, very long, 'business and what-not'â€¦ what exactly does he want?
87794	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It's time to ask for clarification.
90369	You need to ask him how many words he wants and how it should be presented.
94863	How he wants it delivered and most importantly â€“ when's the deadline?
99123	Get those details right and you're on your way to preparing your first assignment.

115420	I really need to know the theme of the assignmentâ€¦
118879	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Duh! Obvious! It's about techniques for good business - is it not?
124092	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>Professor Not to you â€“ and no, I think the question is 'Why is business the life-blood of the economy?'
132274	So just write something about thatâ€¦
134980	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>Yesâ€¦ but how many words do you wantâ€¦ how would you like it presented â€“ text, photos, graphs?
144687	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>Yes Mary, all that kind of stuff.
146997	And hmmm, <strong>I'm easy</strong> - shall we say 2,000 words?
151419	We can meet later if you need more helpâ€¦
153378	<strong>Mary<br></strong>It's OK - just let me know how we should deliver it to you when it's finished.
159787	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>You can drop it round to my house if you like.
162674	<strong>Daniel<br></strong>Oh reallyâ€¦ what's your address?
165437	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>On second thoughts, just email it to me.
167884	My (email) address is on the board.
169778	<strong>Mary<br> </strong>But how long have we gotâ€¦ I mean, when is the deadline for completing our assignment?
174769	<strong>Prof.Not<br></strong>Errr, how about midnight, two weeks tomorrow?
178826	Must dash, I've got a - errrâ€¦. a meeting.
