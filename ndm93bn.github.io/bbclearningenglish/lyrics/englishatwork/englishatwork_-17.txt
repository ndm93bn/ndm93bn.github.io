1	(Introduction...)
5084	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome back! This is what's happening today: as a result of some embarrassing mistakes in deliveries, Tip Top Trading's big boss in America has ordered a re-check of every order this month.
18817	So, Paul is talking to key customers to see if they've got what they needed:
24034	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I just want to check you're happy with the grapes?
27207	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Tom, whom we all know was responsible for the disaster, is phoning his clients to make sure he has the correct information about what they want
37854	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Ya, yah, I just want to make absolutely sure we get the order right for you and have the correct number of fruit.
46859	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Denise is, well, talking on the phone to a friend.
50555	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Brown shoes don't look right on him!
53818	He's not a brown shoe sort of person.
56763	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna has to go down to the warehouse, where the products are prepared for delivery.
62238	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I have to speak to Mr Ingle.
64414	Apparently he's not very friendly!
67204	He might not like me asking lots of questions!
70078	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, be polite, and start your sentences with things like: <br>I just want to make sure that.
77319	Could you possibly clarify.
79663	I just want to check.
81781	Just to be absolutely clear.
84779	One thing I wasn't sure of was.
87971	Good luck!
90459	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Mr Ingle, I don't think we've met yet, I'm Anna.
95170	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>Hello.
96451	Oi! What are you doing with those boxes? I told you to put them in storage.
103004	Anna, is it?
104241	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, sorry to bother you, I just want to check something.
108517	We've had a few problems with ordersâ€¦.
111330	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>Well, that's not my fault. I do exactly what I'm asked to do.
116733	(To workers) No, not there, in storage!
120850	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, well, I just want to make sure thatâ€¦.
124429	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>Thirty years I've been doing this job, and I've never made a mistake.
129240	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Of course, but because we've had problems, we need to make absolutely sure that all deliveries are correct.
136798	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>Humph.
137306	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Could you possibly clarify what went out in today's delivery to Mr Berry of, er, Bluetree Enterprises?
148668	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>500 redcurrants.
151370	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right. That's fine.
153582	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well done Anna, this is going very well.
156611	Remember that other phrase â€“ "I just want to checkâ€¦"
160314	<strong>Anna<br></strong>OK. Now, I just want to check what was sent to Cocoline Limited â€“ it should have been fifteen mangos.
170266	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>Yeah. That's right.
171557	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Great, and just to be absolutely clear, you sent the soft mangos, not the plastic ones?
178706	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>Yes, just like I was told to.
181165	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Good. One thing I wasn't sure of was whether we had enough yellow bananas in stock â€“ I know there are some purple ones, but.
189974	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>Yeah well, we do need more yellow bananas.
193045	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Okay, I'll just write that down.
195626	Thank you Mr Ingle.
197278	By the way, I like your overalls!
200098	<strong>Ingle<br></strong>Oh thanks.
204115	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well he was a bit unfriendly, but Anna got what she needed.
208700	Here are the phrases she used: <br>I just want to make sure that.
213390	Could you possibly clarify.
216563	I just want to check.
219391	Just to be absolutely clear.
222673	One thing I wasn't sure of was.
226886	Well, everything in the warehouse seems to be okay.
230545	Back in the office, Tom is having less luck.
233967	<strong>Tom<br></strong>(on the phone) Really? Here it says 5,000 not five... oh.
241698	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It's going to be a long day for him!
244204	Until next time. Bye!
