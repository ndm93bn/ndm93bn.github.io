1	(Introduction...)
4731	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading where Anna is going downstairs to speak to warehouse manager, Mr Ingle.
12194	Youâ€™re looking a bit nervousâ€¦
14429	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I am. Denise says if I speak to him in the wrong way, he might bite my head off!
20294	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Relax Anna. Itâ€™s just an expression to mean he might be a bit aggressive.
25465	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh!
26359	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Youâ€™ll be fine, just use the right polite phrasesâ€¦ oh, and smile!
31702	<strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, I will. Oh look here I amâ€¦
35415	(Warehouse door opens)
39725	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Mr Ingle, are you there?
42256	Iâ€™d be most grateful if you could give me someâ€¦ oh, whatâ€™s that smellâ€¦ and smokeâ€¦ Mr Ingle!
52637	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Oh, oh (coughs)
54028	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Mr Ingle. Youâ€™re smoking!
57011	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Wellâ€¦ itâ€™s my lunch breakâ€¦ so Iâ€™m allowed to smoke a cigarette, arenâ€™t I?
60990	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Really? Are you sure?
64836	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>No, heâ€™s not Anna! Smoking inside a public building is illegal â€“ itâ€™s against the law.
71335	Itâ€™s dangerous too - youâ€™ve got to do something about this.
74839	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh right. Mmm, er, Mr Ingle, you mustnâ€™t smokeâ€¦ itâ€™s wrong.
82390	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Says who?
83279	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Err, Me?
85545	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna. Youâ€™ll have to do better than that.
87573	Be polite, but be firm too. Try saying, â€˜would you mind not doing that please?â€™
94709	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Iâ€™ll try. Mr Ingle, would you mind not doing that please?
100121	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Whyâ€™s that then?
101685	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Heâ€™s not being very nice is he? You need to give your reasons.
105760	Say, â€˜Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s against company policyâ€™. Go on you can do it.
111389	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Mr Ingleâ€¦ Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s against company policy.
116305	Andâ€¦ it is actually against the law to smoke hereâ€¦ andâ€¦ itâ€™s not a nice smell, is it?
124112	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Well, smells OK to me.
126530	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, Iâ€™m sorry to have to ask you this but you need to put it out.
131814	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Put what out â€“ the cat?!
134195	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No. You need to extinguish your cigaretteâ€¦ please.
138419	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Says who?
139621	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, Iâ€™m sure your team wouldnâ€™t like to see you breaking the law and besides, it could cause a fire.
146160	That would be awful.
148335	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Yeah, I suppose it would.
150915	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I could get you some nicotine gum if you like?
153696	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>No, itâ€™s OK. Iâ€™ll stub it outâ€¦ as you asked so nicely.
159298	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you Mr Ingle. Weâ€™ll keep it a secret this time, but please donâ€™t do it again.
165026	Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s just not permitted on company premises.
168348	<strong>Mr Ingle<br></strong>Yeah, whatever!
169396	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh and Mr Ingle, I still really like your overalls. Bye!
177090	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Nice one Anna. You dealt with Mr Ingle really well.
181177	You kept your cool and explained the reasons why he shouldnâ€™t smoke.
185242	Letâ€™s hope he doesnâ€™t do it again Anna.
187891	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I hope not. I hate the smell of cigarette smoke.
191846	But I never got to ask him about stock management.
194670	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, maybe itâ€™s best to leave it for another time?
198882	Annaâ€™s had a tricky day so far dealing with Mr Ingle but she was firm and fair in the language she used.
206257	Hereâ€™s a reminder of the phrases she used:<br>Would you mind not doing that please?
211176	Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s against company policy.
214423	Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s not permitted.
216391	Sorry to have to ask you this butâ€¦
223194	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Ah Anna, there you areâ€¦.
225598	(sniffing) Have you been smoking?
228274	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No!
228897	<strong>Paul<br></strong>You smell of cigarette smoke.
230944	Look, I know youâ€™re under pressure â€“ but smoking in the building is not permitted.
235380	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Bbbutâ€¦
236141	<strong>Paul<br></strong>We take this very seriously.
238463	You had better step in to my office and weâ€™ll talk about this.
241038	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear! Annaâ€™s in trouble for no reason.
244753	Letâ€™s hope she explains the mix-up, but that means telling Paul about Mr Ingle smoking.
249984	This is going to be difficult. Until next time, bye!
254728	<h3>Listening challenge - answer</h3> <br>What other word does Anna use to mean 'put out your cigarette'? <br>To extinguish.
