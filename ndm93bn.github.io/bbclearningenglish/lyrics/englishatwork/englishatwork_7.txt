1	(Introduction...)
6900	<strong>Narrator</strong><br>Hello again. Well, this is very exciting!
10800	Paul, the boss, is sending Anna and Tom on a business trip to France.
15976	He wants them to clinch the deal with a company interested in buying their Imperial Lemons.
21700	But has Tom got more than business on his mind?
28100	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Really? Whatâ€¦ me and Annaâ€¦ to France?
32800	<strong>Paul</strong><br>Yes but make sure you get that contract signed. We need the business.
37111	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Yeah, yeah, of course. Are we staying overnight?
40800	<strong>Paul</strong> <br>There's no money for that â€“ just get there and come straight back.
44600	Oh and could you bring back those nice French biscuits that have in the duty-free shop?
49400	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Sure. So, Anna, we're off on holiday together are we?!
54300	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>No! But I've got to book the flights online, can you help me please?
59400	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>It's not my thing. I'm sure Denise will help. I need to go and pack for this trip.
69222	<strong>Denise</strong><br>Yes Margeâ€¦ in the cupboardâ€¦ envelopes apparentlyâ€¦ Tom and Annaâ€¦ oh here she isâ€¦ got to go Margeâ€¦ bye.
81334	Hello Anna, everything OK?
84300	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Sort of. I've got to go to France with Tom.
88100	<strong>Denise</strong><br>Yes, I know. I thought you'd be pleased to go with Tom, after your time in the stationery cupboard with him!
95200	<strong>Anna</strong>  <br>I was just finding an envelope Denise.
98300	Anyway, I'm worried about booking the flights online.
102200	I usually book flights at a travel agent's.
105108	<strong>Denise</strong><br>It's company policy now, we have to do everything online â€“ even my food shopping â€“ but donâ€™t tell Paul.
113200	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Oh right. So where shall I begin?
117032	<strong>Denise</strong> <br>Pull up a chair Anna and we'll log on.
124200	Right let's start with the British Airlines website.
130111	There. London to Marseille. What is the outbound date?
134700	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Going out tomorrow, back tomorrow.
140500	<strong>Denise</strong><br>Business class or Economy class? I think we'll say Economy.
145726	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>That's cheaper I guess. What's this mean? Flexible or fixed?
151000	<strong>Denise</strong> <br>A flexible ticket means you can change your flight but a fixed one means you can't â€“ and that's cheaper so we'll choose that one.
159800	I'll book you on the 8am flight from Heathrow and flying home at 6pm.
165600	I just need to type in your full names now and select your seats. Window or aisle?
174200	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>I'll what?
175600	<strong>Denise</strong> <br>No Anna. A seat by the aisle or by the window?
180082	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Oh, an aisle seat please, Denise.
182700	<strong>Denise</strong> <br>Good. What's your frequent flyer number?
186200	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Oh I don't have one of those.
188370	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>What's that? Frequent flyer number? Here I've got a gold status card, can you stick my number in?
195300	<strong>Denise</strong>  <br>Gold status! Where did you get that?
199500	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Oh, I've flown loads of times for business. I've done deals all around the world.
205800	<strong>Narrator</strong>  <br>He means he's been on lots of jollies â€“ free trips paid for by the company â€“ and all he's come home with is a sun tan!
214023	<strong>Denise</strong><br>Hmm, really. Right I just need to pay nowâ€¦ using the company account of course.
222000	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Cool. Now, what do you think of my sunglasses?
226600	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Lovely Tom. Denise has booked you a window seat OK?
232000	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>No! Sorry I can't sit by the windowâ€¦ Iâ€™mâ€¦ errrâ€¦
237200	<strong>Denise</strong> <br>Yes Tom?
238500	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Well, I mean, it's only polite that the lady sits by the window.
242400	<strong>Denise</strong> <br>Really?!
248700	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>What's Tom like?! Hopefully he'll prove a useful business partner for Anna on the trip to France.
255800	Here's a reminder of some of the questions you may be asked when booking a flightâ€¦
260200	<em>What's the outbound and return date?
264008	<em>Do you want to fly business or economy?
267600	<em>Do you want a fixed or flexible ticket?
271600	<em>Would you like a window or aisle seat?
275391	<em>Have you got a frequent flyer number?
284000	<strong>Denise</strong> <br>There you go you two, your e-ticket. Now don't forget your passports.
289800	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Thanks Denise. Hey Anna, I'm so pleased that we're on this trip together.
295100	It'll be nice to spend some time with you.
297777	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Yes and to do some business and really show Paul we are his best employees.
305000	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Oh yeah, of courseâ€¦ I just wonderedâ€¦
309300	<strong>Anna</strong><br>Yes?
310666	<strong>Tom</strong> <br>Is there any chance I could sit in the aisle seat?
314000	<strong>Narrator</strong><br>I've got a feeling Anna's in for a bumpy ride.
317666	Find out how their trip goes next time on English at Work. See ya!
