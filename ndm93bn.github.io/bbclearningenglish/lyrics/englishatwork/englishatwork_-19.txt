5154	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Ah hello! Welcome back to Tip Top Trading â€“ the UK's leading wholesaler of imitation fruit.
13354	Today you're joining us in the middle of the action!
17379	Anna is with an important client Mr Lime, from Citrus Ventures.
22511	He's angry and she'll have to calm him down.
25924	She could cope brilliantly here or this could be a horrible mess!
30286	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well Mr Lime, how can I help you?
33049	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>On Monday I was meant to receive 8,000 plastic grapefruit from Tip Top Trading.
39043	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes.
40001	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>The delivery was made on Tuesday.
42466	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh dear.
44233	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>And instead of 8,000 plastic grapefruit, I got 800,000 plastic pineapples!
51711	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Right Anna, this is serious.
54118	You're going to have to apologise and show that you really mean it.
58693	Say: I'm really sorry to hear that.
61274	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.
64729	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>What on earth am I going to do with 800,000 plastic pineapples?
69615	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Show Mr Lime that you understand the problem.
72713	These are phrases you can use: That's totally unacceptable.
78365	That must have been very inconvenient for you.
81769	And then promise to fix the problem.
84233	Say: You have my word that we will sort this out.
88425	We can do something to make up for the inconvenience.
92476	It won't happen again.
94406	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>800,000 plastic pineapples!
98227	<strong>Anna<br></strong>That's totally unacceptable.
102011	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>I didn't even have anywhere to put them - and pineapples are so much bigger than grapefruit!
107159	<strong>Anna<br></strong>It must have been very inconvenient for you.
109701	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>It certainly was!
110999	When he took my order, your colleague Tom told me that Tip Top Trading was the most reliable firm in the industry!
117847	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You have my word that we will sort this out.
121222	We'll remove the pineapples and have your grapefruit sent via express delivery this afternoon.
126431	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Good. Thank you.
128847	<strong>Anna<br></strong>And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.
135185	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Oh! Well, that would be nice!
138115	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Tip top Anna! Excellent work and excellent words.
141700	<strong>Anna<br></strong>They're made with revolutionary premium faux-orange, laser-curve definition technology.
147636	you will be the first to have them!
150513	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Wow, now that's good customer service!
153794	Tell me, do you have any other artificial fruits in this range?
158560	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes. Well, it's a bit of a secret, but you're a trusted client, so I think I can tell you.
166474	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Go on.
167312	<strong>Anna<br></strong>We're about to unveil a new Imperial Lemon.
170937	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Really?
172152	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I can't tell you any more for now. Butâ€¦
175324	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Yes.
176195	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Maybe we could present it to you more formally in a couple of weeks, when it's ready for release.?
182723	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Sounds perfect.
184414	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You would be the first to see it!
186673	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Excellent. Thank you, er.
189409	Anna, isn't it?
190935	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes.
191623	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>A very pretty name.
193131	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. It's spelled the same forwards and backwards.
196974	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Is it really?
198424	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Anyway, Mr Lime, we'll fix this grapefruit problem for you, and I promise you, it won't happen again.
205451	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Good, good. You're new here, aren't you Anna?
208963	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes.
209730	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Well I look forward to working with you.
212025	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>What a success! Mr Lime has come away a very happy customer!
218772	Here are the phrases Anna used while apologising: <br>I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.
224798	That's totally unacceptable.
227601	It must have been very inconvenient for you.
231128	You have my word that we will sort this out.
