1	(Introduction...)
4682	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading.
7525	An office meeting has been scheduled, but Paul is running late.
11287	He's asked Anna to take charge and start the meeting without him.
15182	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Here you go Anna, it's a print-out of the agenda for the meeting.
19431	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thank you. Oh dear, I'm not sure if I know the right words to start meetings.
24473	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, you can say something like: <strong>Thank you for coming.
28549	There are five items on the agenda today.
31794	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Items?
33153	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It's a fancy way of saying 'things'.
36130	Then you list them: <strong>Firstly, secondly, after that, and then, finally.
43928	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, that's easy.
45717	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>At the end there is often something called<strong>&nbsp;Any other business</strong>.
49750	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Any other business?
51175	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>That's anything else that wasn't listed on the agenda, but that people want to talk about.
56382	I expect Tom will want to talk about how great he is and Denise will want to talk about her new hairdresser or something.
63843	Then when it's time for the meeting to end, you can say: <strong>Let's wrap up</strong>.
68298	It means 'Let's finish'.
70455	<strong>Anna<br></strong>To wrap up. OK, I'll do my best.
74176	Ooh, it's time, everyone is gathering.
80337	Thank youâ€¦ thank you for coming.
83005	Paul will be here soon, but he asked me to start the meeting.
87464	There are...one, two, three, four items on the agenda today.
94828	Firstly, the stock management systems.
98985	Secondly, plans for a team-building activity.
104233	After that, the colour of our new apples and finally any other business, before we can wrap up.
111461	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh golly gosh, there you are, here I am, good.
115708	Hello everyone. Sorry I'm late.
117533	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I'd just opened the meeting.
119080	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Great. Remind me what the first item on the agenda is?
123673	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Stock.
124787	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Stock? Stock, stock, stock.
129120	Ah yes, stock management systems, yes, right.
132712	Well, that's mainly to announce that we need to start developing a good stock management system so we can meet the huge demand Iâ€™m expecting for these laser-curved fruits.
143068	Anna, I'd like you to lead on that.
148270	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Me? You want me to be in charge of the stock management systems?
152629	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna's had some excellent ideas already and I think she'll do a great job.
157315	For these new fruits, stock control will be key to supplying our customers with laser-curve oranges, laser-curve lemons, laser-curve pomegramatesâ€¦
170128	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, that was good news for Anna - but not surprising after all her hard work.
175168	She opened the meeting well, too.
177720	Here's a reminder of the phrases she used: <br>Thank you for coming.
182152	There are four items on the agenda today.
185600	Firstly.
187233	Secondly.
188933	After that.
190957	Then.
192460	And finally.
194274	Any other business.
196241	And then we can wrap up.
199625	There's only one problem for Anna now, winning over Mr Ingle the warehouse manager â€“ that wonâ€™t be easy.
206873	Well, time for me to wrap up now. See you soon! Bye!
