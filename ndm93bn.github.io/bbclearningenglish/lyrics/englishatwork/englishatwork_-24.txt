4479	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello! Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading, where Anna's&nbsp;interview for a sales job continues.
12315	When we last said goodbye, Tip Top&nbsp;boss Paul had asked Anna why she wanted the job.
18405	First she said:
20104	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Errr... mmmmm...
23271	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Since then, she's added:
25680	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Mmmm... errr...
28862	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>And as we join her again, Anna is saying:
32224	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, errrr... I'm errr...
36916	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Come on, Anna! If you can't think of the word you need, find another way of saying it.
43108	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I am. Well, I really, really want this job and I am willing to work very&nbsp;hard if I get it.
51563	<strong>Paul<br></strong>So youâ€™re very motivated, then?
55164	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Motivated! Yes, thatâ€™s it. I am really motivated.
59351	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Good! Why?
61437	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Now over to you Anna; structure your answer!
65601	Say, 'firstly', then give your&nbsp;first reason, 'secondly' and then a second reason.
72944	Then say, 'above all' and&nbsp;give a really, really good, enthusiastic final reason!
80532	Go for it: firstly!
83012	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Firstly!
84902	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Firstly.?
87254	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent&nbsp;several years working in sales and I get on with people easily.
97617	Well, I mean, apart from the ones I don't like, of course.
101524	Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to&nbsp;be part of that.
109696	<strong>Paul<br></strong>That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in&nbsp;the plastic fruit sector.
116538	But enough about the company; this is all about you, Annabel.
119437	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Anna.
120058	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Sorry, Anna. Where were we?
122157	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, I said that firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and&nbsp;experience, secondly, the company is growing fast.
131025	andâ€¦ andâ€¦ above allâ€¦ the reason I want this job isâ€¦
136725	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Yes? (knock on the door) Denise! Is everything alright?
142316	<strong>Denise<br></strong>No Paul, itâ€™s not. Everything is not OK!
147398	<strong>Paul<br></strong>You look pale. Here, sit down, drink what's left of my tea.
151551	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh, thank you! Ohâ€¦ what are those bits floating in it?
155958	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh they're just lumps of soggy biscuit.
159032	In fact, if I can just... get that bit out... with my finger... for youâ€¦ Mmm, delicious!
165311	Now, tell me what happened.
166893	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Well, it's terrible.
171473	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear! Just as Anna was doing really well, it looks like her interview has&nbsp;come to a sudden end.

203363	Anna couldnâ€™t remember the word â€˜motivatedâ€™, so she just found another way of saying what she meant.
