1	(Introduction...)
5243	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello again. Itâ€™s the big day and Mr Socrates is about to arrive at the offices of Tip Top Trading to talk officially to the team.
14715	What is he going to say? And more importantly, will he get his freshly squeezed orange juice?
23257	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Quickly everybodyâ€¦ heâ€™s coming out of the lift with Paul.
26958	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Anna quickly, get a glass of orange juice ready.
32621	<strong>Paul<br></strong>â€¦and if we come through this door here we get to the office andâ€¦ morning everyone.
39433	Iâ€™m sure weâ€™ve all met Mr Socrates on the day of theâ€¦ fireâ€¦ but today everything is a bit calmer and well heâ€™s here to say hello.
51001	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Hi!
51946	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Biscuit Mr Socrates?
53931	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Biscuit? You mean a goddamn cookie. Thanks.
57404	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Err, Mr Socrates, Iâ€™m Anna. Would you like some orange juice â€“ freshly squeezed?
65008	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>You betcha as long as itâ€™s made from Florida oranges.
68615	Heyâ€¦ Anna? Ainâ€™t you the girl who booked my hotel room?
72230	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh yes, sorry about the bed andâ€¦
75525	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Hey, you got me a new room, it was great.
77789	You did a good job there. Well done.
80017	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh thanks.
82256	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Hello. Itâ€™s Tom. I recommended the hotel, it was aâ€¦
87810	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Tom. Everyone, shall we gather round and hear what Mr Socrates has to say? Please.
93355	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Heyâ€¦ errr, whatâ€™s your nameâ€¦
95824	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Paul.
96871	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Yeah you. Donâ€™t you think I should be sitting in the big chair?
100342	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Sorry. Yes of course. (Shuffling) There you go.
107214	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Now. Tip Top Trading. I gotta give it to you straight.
111937	Things ainâ€™t looking good, in fact the outlook is gloomy.
115933	The global recession has led to a meltdown in the plastic fruits sector.
120001	And Iâ€™ve got to announce a profit warning.
123092	We just ainâ€™t selling enough of these bananas, oranges and lemons to make any money.
128563	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Thereâ€™s a bit of an economic squeeze on lemons!
131223	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>What?!
131867	<strong>Anna<br></strong>(To herself) Oh dear. Iâ€™m not sure what heâ€™s talking about but it sounds bad.
138278	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It is Anna. Heâ€™s delivering some bad news without hiding the truth.
143565	Thatâ€™s why he said â€œIâ€™ve got to give it to you straightâ€.
147205	He said â€œthe outlook is gloomyâ€ which it means the future doesnâ€™t look good.
152985	And he mentioned a â€œprofit warningâ€, which means company profits are probably going to go down.
159377	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Crikey! That is bad. What does it mean?
164639	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Just keep listening for now.
166679	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>â€¦so, this calls for action. Iâ€™m going to have toâ€¦
171448	<strong>Tom<br></strong>(interrupts) Oh no, not me Mr Socrates, Iâ€™ve been a loyal employee, I couldnâ€™t face being unemployed.
181338	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Tom, calm down.
183764	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Iâ€™m not talking about redundancies yet.
186646	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Gosh, well that calls for another biscuit.
189615	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>My plan isâ€¦ weâ€™re going into Europe.
195668	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You mean weâ€™re moving to Europe?
198177	<strong>Paul<br></strong>No, no Anna. I think he means weâ€™re going to sell plastic fruit to the European market.
204002	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh right! Great. Mr Socrates, Iâ€™ve lots of experience with Europe.
210536	I had a holiday in Spain onceâ€¦ twice actually.
214297	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Well weâ€™ll have to make sure our phones can make international calls.
218464	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Hmm. I think youâ€™re gonna need some help with this, so Iâ€™m bringing in my best marketing executive, Rachel.
224963	What she doesnâ€™t know about selling to Europe, you donâ€™t wanna know.
228997	Sheâ€™ll be here in a few weeksâ€™ time.
230880	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Do you know if she prefers tea or coffeeâ€¦ or orange juice perhaps?
236342	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Look Dianaâ€¦
238257	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Deniseâ€¦
240219	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>Denise. Like Dennis right?
243445	Sheâ€™ll want the best â€“ the best tea, coffee, the best team.
248150	Iâ€™ll expect improved results and profits.
251326	If not your necks will be on the line â€“ especially yours Paul.
255778	<strong>Paul<br></strong>(nervously) Oh, chop chop. Weâ€™d better get to work.
265093	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Scary! â€œYour necks will be on the lineâ€ â€“ he means their jobs will be at risk if things donâ€™t improve.
273308	Itâ€™s a worrying time for Tip Top Trading.
276411	Letâ€™s remind ourselves of the phrases Mr Socrates used to deliver bad news:<br>Iâ€™ve got to give it to you straight<br>The outlook is gloomy<br>Iâ€™ve got to announce a profit warning<br>Letâ€™s hope this new marketing strategy for Europe is going to work.
294951	How are you feeling Anna?
296559	<strong>Anna<br></strong>A little nervous. But Iâ€™m going to try my best to make sure this new strategy works.
302249	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Thatâ€™s the spirit Anna!
303885	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Right everyone. I think we need to take Mr Socrates down to the Rose and Crown after work for a pint or two and show him some true English hospitality. How about it?
314226	<strong>Mr S<br></strong>I donâ€™t drink.
315435	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Ah well, perhaps some lemonade?
319472	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear. This should be interesting. Until next time, bye!
324956	<h3>Listening challenge - answer</h3> <br>Which market does Mr Socrates want to focus the business on? <br>The European market.
