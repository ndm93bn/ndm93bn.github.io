1	(Introduction...)
9608	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Bye bye Mr Socrates. Heâ€™s flying back to America leaving Tip Top Tradingâ€™s London team trying to work out how best to focus their business on the European market.
21900	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Sorry to keep you waiting. I had to go to the airport with Mr Socrates to see him off.
27520	We had a good chat in the taxi and he said some very positive things.
32191	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh yes. Like what?
34554	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Err, wellâ€¦ well, how nice English beer is.
39273	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah but what about the European marketing strategy â€“ what are we going to do about that?
45306	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Well, Anna is supposed to lead on that, Iâ€™m taking a more biscuitorial control over it.
52052	<strong>Anna<br></strong>A what?
53385	<strong>Tom<br></strong>It means you do all the work while he eats all the biscuits!
57430	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Do you mind Tom. Now, what Iâ€™m thinking is we put the feelers out â€“ do some cold calling, see what people are buying at the moment.
66402	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Cold calling? But I like to be warm when Iâ€™m on the phone.
71389	<strong>Denise<br></strong>No Anna. Cold calling is when you call prospective clients when theyâ€™re not expecting you to, to ask them something or to sell them something.
82402	Iâ€™m very good at calling people.
85071	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, usually the hair dresser!
87241	So Paul, where do we begin, who do we call first?
90652	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Track down some potential clients in Europe, see what theyâ€™re buying now, see what they want in the future.
96759	Make them think itâ€™s our laser-curved fruit they want!
100856	<strong>Denise<br></strong>But keep your calls brief, international calls are very expensive.
109144	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>OK Anna, itâ€™s time to cold call.
112248	What are you going to say?
113927	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I donâ€™t know.
115266	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Find someone to call, then be pleasant and polite.
119327	When you call, ask to speak to the person who deals with buying or purchasing.
124786	And then ask that person if they could spare a few minutes of their time.
129577	<strong>Anna<br></strong>OK. Here goes.
135590	(Looking through a telephone directory) Letâ€™s have a lookâ€¦ fruit growers, fruit pickers, fruit tradersâ€¦ Fruit Traders Internationalâ€¦ (Dials number) 0-0-4-3-9-8-4-5-5-4-4.
162502	<strong>Trader<br></strong>Bonjour?
163584	<strong>Anna<br></strong>(surprised) Ah, erm, ohâ€¦.
165808	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Donâ€™t be surprised! Youâ€™ve called a company in France, they speak French.
170970	Just ask if itâ€™s OK to speak English.
173950	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hello. Is it possible to speak to you in English?
178316	<strong>Trader<br></strong>Ouiâ€¦ yes.
180441	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Great. Are you the person who purchases plastic fruit for your company?
186004	<strong>Trader<br></strong>I am. How can I help you?
189049	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, can you spare a few minutes of your time?
193398	I want to sell you some laser-curved fruit.
196571	<strong>Trader<br></strong>What?!
198142	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Thatâ€™s a bit direct Anna.
200048	Slow down and tell them your name and why youâ€™re calling.
204080	Find out something about them.
206087	Maybe say â€œIâ€™d like to tell you about our great new laser-curved fruitâ€.
211746	Ask them â€œHow much plastic fruit do you buy?â€
215285	and at the end of the call say â€œThank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.â€
221094	Give it a go Anna.
223230	<strong>Anna<br></strong>OK. Ermâ€¦ hello my name is Anna.
228618	How are you today?
230204	<strong>Trader<br></strong>Good thank you.
232203	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thatâ€™s good. Iâ€™d like to tell you about our great new laser-curved fruit.
237657	<strong>Trader<br></strong>Oh yes.
238764	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Our company is called Tip Top Trading and we are the UKâ€™s number 1 plastic fruit manufacturer â€“ and well, weâ€™re so proud of our fruit that weâ€™ve decided to let the rest of Europe enjoy it too.
254456	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Very good Anna!
255973	<strong>Anna<br></strong>We make our fruit using laser-curved technology.
259935	In fact weâ€™ve just launched our best product ever, the Imperial Lemon â€“ it looks so real you want to squeeze it.
269069	<strong>Trader<br></strong>Hmm, lemons, interesting.
273114	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Annaâ€™s got the hang of this â€“ sheâ€™s on fire â€“ I mean, sheâ€™s doing really well.
280258	Her cold calling technique has really warmed up.
283709	Sheâ€™s pitched the products now she needs to sell.
290219	<strong>Anna<br></strong>â€¦so thank you for your time.
293334	I hope you may consider us when you next purchase some plastic fruit.
297509	<strong>Trader<br></strong>We will certainly consider your company.
300932	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well we hope to hear from you soon.
303702	Goodbye (puts phone down).
305087	Tom, Tom, how are you getting on?
307653	<strong>Tom<br></strong>(On phone/angry) â€¦well if thatâ€™s what you think then you can shove your kumquatsâ€¦ hello?
312471	Hello? (Slams phone down)
315507	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Whatâ€™s wrong?
316312	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Theyâ€™ve hung up on me. Really!
319735	He said the plastic fruit industry is in meltdown.
325004	But Anna, if I donâ€™t get any contracts soon Iâ€™ll be fired.
330142	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, this calls for teamwork Tom â€“ tomorrow, Tuesday, weâ€™re going to tackle this task â€“ together!
338081	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hooray for Anna. Now sheâ€™s sounding like a leader.
342419	And sheâ€™s mastered cold calling by using some simple phrases, like these:<br>My name is Anna.
349354	Can you spare a few minutes of your time?
352279	Iâ€™d like to tell you about our great new laser-curved fruit<br>How much plastic fruit do you buy?
359505	Thank you for your time.
361249	We hope to hear from you soon.
364219	Phone rings
370425	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Anna. Thereâ€™s a call for you, from someone in France, they want to talk to you about lemons.
379115	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Sounds promising.
