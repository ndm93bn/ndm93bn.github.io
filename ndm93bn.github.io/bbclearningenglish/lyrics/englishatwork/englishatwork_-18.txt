4520	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Good afternoon.
5616	<strong>Anna & Tom<br></strong>Hi, good afternoon.
7455	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna, Tom, room 301 please. Now.
11676	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome back to Tip Top Trading, where things are a teeny bit tense today.
17533	Paul has called Tom and Anna into room 301, the place where difficult conversations happen.
24526	Perhaps Paul has found out about yesterday's unhappy clients.
29386	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh dear.
31284	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>You should be okay Anna.
33109	After the way you coped with Mr Lime, you should be praised.
37258	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Really? What do you think Paul will say?
40012	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, if he is pleased, he'll say things like: <br>Well done.
44266	You handled it well.
46177	Great job.
47552	I'm really impressed.
50006	<strong>Anna<br></strong>And if he's not?
51652	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, I suppose â€“ oop. Hereâ€™s Paul now!
59182	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Well, Tom, Anna. Yesterday was not a great day.
65702	Two clients came in with serious complaints.
65856	Mrs Kumquat received a delivery of imitation bananas that were purple, not very convincing.
74232	And Mr Lime ordered grapefruits, but got pineapples. Tom.
78627	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yes.
79981	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Were you responsible for these errors?
81972	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Well. yes, butâ€¦
84801	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Look, mistakes happen.
86366	But it seems that Mrs Kumquat left our offices even angrier than when she came in and she says she will never use Tip Top Trading again.
94937	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I tried my best.
97335	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Hmmm. I understand you told her to spray-paint the bananas and to 'stop being such a miserable old witch'.
103416	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, well look, she'd been very rude to me.
106294	<strong>Paul<br></strong>If you weren't such a good salesman I would fire you for that. Anna.
110030	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes.
110863	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Well done. Not only was Mr Lime satisfied that his problem would be resolved, but we might even get some extra business from him, thanks to your Imperial Lemon proposal.
122141	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I hope so.
123343	<strong>Paul<br></strong>You were in a difficult situation and you handled it well.
126992	You remained calm, friendly and professional. So, great job.
133457	I'm really impressed. I'm going toâ€¦
136122	(phone rings)
136538	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Who's that? Oh no. It's a call from the USA.
139805	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh god!
141473	<strong>Anna<br></strong>What?
142438	<strong>Tom<br></strong>It's the boss!
143964	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Whose boss?
145119	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Ours! The big, big boss, based in America.
149632	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Shhhh! (on the phone) Hellooo?
153722	Ah, good afternoon Mr Socrates, I mean, er- morning, ha ha, where you are it's â€¦ yes, no, n-yes â€¦.
162292	I'm not sure.
163542	Mrs Kumquat â€¦ did she?
166606	â€¦ well, it was very unfortunate â€¦.
170758	purple, yes â€¦. totally unacceptable â€¦.
175078	I will. If you'd like I could â€¦.
178300	Mr Socrates? Hello? Mr Socrates? Oh, he's gone.
183933	Right where was I? Tom, great work. Anna, I'm disappointed.
191177	No, no, Anna, great work, I want you to take charge of the Imperial Lemon presentation.
197939	Tom, if you speak to a client like that again there will be disciplinary action.
203855	Mrs Kumquat was so angry she even emailed Mr Socrates. Ok, thatâ€™s it.
214107	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Phew! What a relief for Anna.
217241	Let's listen again to some of the phrases Paul used to praise her: <br>Well done.
223086	You were in a difficult situation and you handled it well.
226996	So, great job. I'm really impressed.
230721	He also explained why he thought Anna had done a good job: <br>You remained calm, friendly and professional.
240265	Excellent work Anna. But Tom's mistakes have given everyone a lot of work to do tomorrow.
246301	<strong>Paul<br></strong>First thing tomorrow we need to sort this mess out.
248711	Tom, I want you to phone every single client and check the orders.
253375	Anna, you can go to the warehouse and find out what's going on in there!
