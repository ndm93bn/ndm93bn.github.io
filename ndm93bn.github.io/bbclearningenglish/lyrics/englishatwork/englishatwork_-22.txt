1	(Introduction...)
4560	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Last week, Anna got the job of sales executive at Tip Top Trading, thanks&nbsp;to her quick-thinking in an office crisis.
13105	Today it's her first day in the office. How are you feeling now, Anna?
17960	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Excited, but a bit worried. I really want to make a good first impression.
23372	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, you're going to need some phrases to introduce yourself politely, such as: <br>Hello, I don't think we've met.
31367	You must be â€“ and say the person's name.
35835	I've just joined the team.
38536	Nice to meet you.
40753	Have you worked here long?
48035	Why don't you start by saying hello to Tom Darcy, the Senior Account Manager?
53213	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yah, yah, no, yah, yah, OK, yah. I'll seal the deal, yah, no worries. OK, see ya mate, bye!
58700	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Hello, I don't think we've met.
61376	<strong>Tom<br></strong>No.
62450	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You must be Tom.
65007	I'm Anna. I've just joined the team.
68075	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Uh huh.
69062	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Nice to meet you. Have you worked here long?
73413	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Sorry, I'm quite busy right now â€“ I've got a big deal just coming through.
80464	But let's get together sometime. Um... can you do lunch tomorrow?
85599	<strong>Anna<br></strong>You want me to do lunch? Well, I'm not very -
88282	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Sorry, important client. Lunch tomorrow at 12. 30 then?
92110	(On the phone) Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie! So what's the latest, are we on?
97490	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, OK then.
99062	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Great Anna! You used some nice phrases to introduce yourself.
103868	It's a shame Tom thinks he's too important to do the same.
107725	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I'm sure he's just busy.
109111	But I'm a bit worried about tomorrow!
111770	(The next dayâ€¦)
117885	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Good morning Paul!
119583	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Good morning Anna, are you OK?
123077	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Fine, the kitchen's through there, isn't it?
126283	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Er, yes.
127914	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Anna!
130615	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh hi, Denise!
132397	<strong>Denise<br></strong>What are you doing?
134596	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Cooking lunch for Tom.
137104	<strong>Denise<br></strong>You what?
138491	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom asked me to have lunch ready for 12.30.
141503	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Did he indeed?
146283	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Er, Anna.
147932	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Hi Tom!
148891	<strong>Tom<br></strong>What are you doing?
150433	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Spring rolls, followed by crispy duck in black bean sauce.
155800	<strong>Tom<br></strong>No, I mean, why are you cooking?
158391	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, if I don't start now, it won't be ready for you by 12.30.
163695	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh, you misunderstood me, Anna.
166202	When I said "Can you do lunch?" it didn't mean "Can you make lunch?"
170720	It meant "Are you available to come to lunch with me?" In a cafe or something.
176079	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh!
176768	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Mmm. something smells good, but what's going on here?
181322	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Anna thinks it's her job to cook for people!
184470	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No, no, I misunderstood!
186678	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna just got a bit confused.
189097	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Well, never mind, it looks tasty.
192070	<strong>Anna<br></strong>There's enough for everyone if you want some.
194232	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I think that's a splendid idea, we can have an office picnic!
198554	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes!
199264	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Mmm, that sauce looks delicious.
201923	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, it's my favourite.
206202	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, once again everything has worked out well for Anna!
209980	Before we go, a reminder of the phrases she used: <br>Hello, I don't think we've met.
216136	You must be Tom.
217915	I've just joined the team.
220074	Nice to meet you.
221766	Have you worked here long?
224384	Just remember - if somebody says "Would you like to do lunch?"
229155	they're not usually expecting you to cook for them! Goodbye.
