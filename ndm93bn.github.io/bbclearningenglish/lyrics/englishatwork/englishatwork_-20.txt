11843	<strong>Denise<br></strong>(on the phone)...And Margery said: 'I don't think I've ever seen a&nbsp;vegetable quite that size before.'
21096	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Where's that hole-punch?!
24372	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Ah, business as usual in the offices of Tip Top Trading.
29960	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh for goodness sake!
32427	What a disaster! I can't believe it!
35280	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>But one member of the team seems bothered.
38442	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Arrgh!
39295	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, this is the moment to show youâ€™re willing to help.
43789	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes!
44652	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Use phrases like 'Is there anything I can do?''
48808	'Let me help!' or, to be more informal, you can say, 'Can I give you a hand?''
54885	or 'Give me a shout if you need anything!
58350	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right.
59222	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Go on!
65233	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Are you okay Tom?
66860	<strong>Tom<br></strong>(grumpily) No.
67857	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Is there anything I can do?
70089	<strong>Tom<br></strong>(grumpily) No.
71177	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh. What's wrong?
72863	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Everything.
74662	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I see. Can I give you a hand?
78458	<strong>Tom<br></strong>My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone.
82727	And there's a big, big problem with my timetable.
87174	Iâ€™ve got two meetings scheduled at the same<br>time with two extremely important clients.
93393	I can't do them both at once!
95612	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Let me help.
97186	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Thanks Anna, but these are big, big clients. They need someone of experience.
103548	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, give me a shout if you need anything!
106011	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I can handle this, alright?
107822	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>'I can handle this'... ungrateful idiot.
110814	But you used all the right phrases Anna, well done.
114398	Anyway, I bet he'll change his mind.
117057	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oooh, I know, and the purple ones are so much more powerful.
121851	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna? Could you help me?
125589	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Ha! I told you so!
127789	<strong>Tom<br></strong>They've both arrived at once!
131904	Oh god! I'll deal with Mrs Kumquat.

146281	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Are you sure that's a good idea Tom?
148769	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I don't have much choice, do I?
150855	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Well I could
152141	<strong>Tom</strong><br>Just keep him occupied Anna, tell him how great he is.
156043	no, no, tell him how great I am.
158511	Find out what he wants.
159992	If it's about the - well, never mind, just be nice.
165468	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Understood.
166846	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Mr Lime! Are you well?
170549	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Yes, but I'm actually rather angry too.
173680	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Ah, well let me introduce you to Anna!
177085	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Mr Lime, it's a pleasure to meet you!
179630	Let me help with your coat.
181322	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Oh er. Thank you.
183258	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Can I give you a hand with your scarf too, Mr Lime?
187063	<strong>Mr Lime<br></strong>Oh. Thanks.
188640	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Now, please come this way and you can tell me what's wrong.
193111	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well done! Anna used some good phrases to step in and help with this&nbsp;mess.
198664	Let's hear them again: <br>Is there anything I can do?
202591	Let me help.
204042	Can I give you a hand?
