1	(Introduction...)
4700	<strong>Anna <br></strong>Help, help!
7616	<strong>Tom   <br></strong>Help us! We're locked in.
10621	<strong>Narrator <br></strong>Oh dear. Do you remember that Tom and Anna are locked in the stationery cupboard?
16844	What are they going to do? And what will people say when they are discovered in there?
21993	I have a feeling we're about to find outâ€¦
25026	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Goodness, what's that? Anna is that you? And is that you Tom?
31742	<strong>Anna <br></strong>Yes, help! We're locked in.
34959	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Don't panic, I've got the key.
40400	There. How on earthâ€¦
44300	<strong>Tom<br></strong>â€¦it's not how it looks Denise. We were justâ€¦ ermâ€¦
50114	<strong>Anna<br></strong>â€¦just looking for envelopes.
51996	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Really?!
53054	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, yes, really. The door slammed shut and locked from the inside when Tom walked in.
59800	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, she's right. Just walked in, and shut the door and bang.
66352	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Hmm. Let's just keep it our little secret shall we.
70763	(<em>Aside to Anna</em>) I thought you had better taste Anna!
75844	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Ah there you are Anna, I need a word with youâ€¦ Oh, you look like you've been caught doing something you shouldn't! Ha ha.
82609	<strong>Anna<br></strong>â€¦but I haven't.
83900	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Just joking Anna.
85046	Now could you step in to my office, we need to touch base about the European marketing strategy.
90969	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Are we playing baseball?!
93100	<strong>Narrator <br></strong>No Anna! Touch base.
95853	He wants to catch up with you, probably to see how you're getting on.
100444	Go on Anna, let's see what he has to say.
103555	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh I see. That door doesn't lock does it?
109444	<strong>Paul  <br></strong>No, I don't think so. Right Anna.
113074	Biscuit? These new peanut ones are quite nice.
118373	So how are things with the project?
121397	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, I've done some cold calling and have an order from a company in France.
127511	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I see. Very impressive but have they signed on the dotted line yet?
132963	<strong>Anna<br></strong>The dotted line?
134853	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Have they actually signed the contract yet?
137864	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, no, butâ€¦
139555	<strong>Paul<br></strong>â€¦that's the problem. There's a rival company who's also targeting the European market called Tutti Fruity - and they'll do anything to steal our customers.
149912	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh I see.
152000	<strong>Paul<br></strong>So, to keep our head above water, we need a clear strategyâ€¦ and that's why I've put you in charge.
158679	So what shall we do?
161222	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>I've a feeling Paul hasn't a clue â€“ that's why he wants you to come up with the ideas.
167900	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I think you're right â€“ but I don't know what to say.
171670	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Tell him we need to <em>price the rivals out of the market, </em>that means offer the lowest prices so nobody wants to buy plastic fruit from our rivals.
182438	You could say that we need to <em>corner the market, </em>that means Tip Top Trading dominates the plastic fruit market.
190700	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, thanks. That's very useful.
194410	<strong>Paul<br></strong>So Anna, any thoughts?
196805	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Lots Paul. I think we've got to compete on price.
200966	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh yes?
201848	<strong>Anna<br></strong>We need to price Tutti Fruity out of the market.
205965	We need to corner the market so that everyone knows we are the best choice for good quality, good value plastic fruit.
215111	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I like it!
216193	<strong>Anna <br></strong>Andâ€¦ andâ€¦
218111	<strong>Narrator</strong>  <br>Tell him we need to<em> build good relationships with our customers</em> â€“ that means we give them good service.
225333	<strong>Anna</strong><br>â€¦we need to build good relationships with our customers.
229647	Talk to them regularly, send them giftsâ€¦ go and meet them face to face.
236702	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Face to face? Yes, great idea â€“ just what I was thinking.
241997	If we follow this strategy I reckon there could be a bonus for us all by Christmas.
254590	<strong>Narrator <br></strong>Well done Anna. Very convincing.
258064	If you can put your ideas into practice you'll save the company.
263111	Let's remind ourselves of the words you used to create the European marketing strategyâ€¦
269063	<em>We've got to compete on price.
271816	<em>We need to price the rivals out of the market.
275438	<em>We need to corner the market.
278145	<em>We need to build good relationships with our customers.
283620	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, things seem to be going well for Annaâ€¦ or are they?
288160	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Anna! Anna! That man from France has called again and left a message.
293742	He's not happy this time. Something about us trying to rip them off!
298975	<strong>Anna <br></strong>What? Rip them off?
301684	<strong>Denise <br></strong>It means over charging them or giving them poor quality goods.
305686	<strong>Anna <br></strong>That's not fair. I'm going to have to sort this out.
309799	<strong>Narrator   <br></strong>That's it Anna â€“ go and build a good relationship with your customer! Bye for now.
