4333	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello again. It's a difficult day at the offices of Tip Top Trading.
10066	The office assistant Denise is losing her job, and today is her last day.
16229	Anna is busy with her work and trying to get everyone to sign Denise's leaving card.
22650	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Paul, have you signed Denise's leaving card yet?
25967	<strong>Paul<br></strong>No, not yet. Have you got a pen?
28999	"Sorry to see you go.Best foot forward. Paul."
34420	There. I feel a bit guilty, it was me who got rid of her.
40111	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah. Well, you should feel really bad.
42728	I can't believe you're getting rid of her.
44433	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom, do you want to sign the card?
46999	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yeah, of course.
48444	"You areâ€¦wereâ€¦the best employee we ever had. So sad to see you go. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Tom."
60500	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Gosh. Three kisses! Erm, you haven't given me any money for her leaving present yet, have you?
66777	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh sorry, a bit of a cash flow problemâ€¦ Here, have a pound.
72666	<strong>Paul<br></strong>That's generous!
78600	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh crumbs, she's crying again. Anna, could you deal with her? I've got something important to do.
88333	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh yeah. Me too.
93628	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Denise, are you OK? Are you upset about leaving?
98666	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Yes. I've loved working here.
101888	I've made some good friendsâ€¦ like you Annaâ€¦ Oh, and being able to make free phone calls has been good.
111603	What am I going to do now?
114777	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear Anna. It sounds like Denise needs some career advice.
119777	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Career advice?
121555	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>She needs some guidance on what to do next and where to find another job. What would you do in her situation?
129500	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Look in the newspaper, ring my contacts, register with a job agency?
135320	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Exactly! I'm sure you can give her some good advice. Go on, give it a go!
141333	<strong>Anna<br></strong>OK, I'll try. Cheer up Denise, you need to think positively.
148000	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Do I? I'm unemployed from tomorrow, how am I ever going to find another job?
155279	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, have you tried looking in the job section of the newspaper?
159920	<strong>Denise<br></strong>No.
161666	<strong>Anna<br></strong>It's a good place to start. And there are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for.
167777	<strong>Denise<br></strong>I don't have a computer.
170008	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well what about ringing some of the people you know; contacts who may know about a job.
176444	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Hmm, I hadn't thought about that.
179444	<strong>Anna<br></strong>And of course, you could register with a recruitment agency. They're good at finding jobs for you.
186222	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh, that's a good idea. Anna, you're brilliant! What great ideasâ€¦ you're so kind andâ€¦ thoughtful.
198777	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna could youâ€¦ Oh no, she's crying again.
202999	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh no, shall we go back into your office Paul?
206777	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No, no. It's OK, Denise is crying with happiness. She's feeling better now.
211996	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh well, in that caseâ€¦ shall we all gather round and officially say goodbye to Denise.
225000	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It's an emotional day for Denise, but Anna has been really useful with her career advice.
231918	If a professional career advisor is not available, giving some of your own advice can sometimes be useful.
239444	Let's hear again what Anna suggestedâ€¦
241953	<em>You need to think positively.
244816	<em>Try looking in the job section of the newspaper.
248698	<em>There are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for.
253444	<em>What about ringing some of the people you know?
257111	<em>You could register with a recruitment agency.
265777	<strong>Paul<br></strong>OK everyone, the time has come to say farewell to Denise. It's with regret we've had to let her go.
273900	<strong>Tom<br></strong>We? You, Paul.
276110	<strong>Pau<br></strong>Thank you for all your hard work and we wish you very well in the future.
284936	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Anna, I think we have a gift for Denise?
288493	<strong>Anna<br></strong>There you go Denise. Careful, it's quite heavy.
295835	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Oh, what a beautiful fruit bowlâ€¦ and full of plastic fruit!
306444	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I'll get it.
316600	Sorry about that everyone. That was a company called Nice'n'Cheesy, they remember you Anna.
323100	They liked your sales pitch and want to order a hundred thousand plastic grapes to go with their cheeses!
330222	<strong>Paul<br></strong>What?! Brilliant! Ooops.
334777	<strong>Denise<br></strong>My new fruit bowl!
342222	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Oh dear. Poor Denise!
346265	It looks like she might be leaving the company at just the wrong time. I wonder if she'll be back?
352301	You'll have to join us again for the next episode of English at Work. Bye!
