4400	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Could I have a word Anna, in my office?
9111	<strong>Narrator  <br></strong>Hello again. I wonder what Paul wants to say to Anna?
13333	Could it have something to do with Rachel, the pen thief - or is it just to do with biscuits?! Let's find out.
24800	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Have a seatâ€¦ so well done for speaking to her. Stealing all those pens from the office was the final straw.
31960	<strong>Anna<br></strong>She was stealing straws?
33950	<strong>Paul<br></strong>No, no. It was the final thing that she did wrong â€“ and it meant disciplinary action.
39988	I've had to 'let her go' â€“ in other words, sack her.
44055	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, so she's gone. But what is Mr Socrates going to say?
50100	She was his best employee.
52500	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Leave it with me. Iâ€™m sure he'll understandâ€¦I hope.
58700	Now, I wanted to speak to you about your appraisal.
62500	<strong>Anna<br></strong>My appraisal?
64280	<strong>Paul   <br></strong>Yes, we do it every year. It's a chance to talk about you, talk about the highs and lows of the past year and look forward.
72073	<strong>Anna     <br></strong>Highs and lows? But I haven't been walking up any hills.
76222	<strong>Narrator  <br></strong>No Anna! He means your appraisal is about reviewing your performance and setting objectives for the year ahead.
84700	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I see. But what are objectives?
88222	<strong>Narrator   <br></strong>These are tasks for you to do, to try and improve your performance and skills and help the business.
94899	Here are the questions youâ€™re likely to hear in an appraisal: <br><em>What's gone well for you this year?
102600	<em>What didn't go so well?
105300	<em>What should you do more of?
107900	<em>Let's look ahead and set some objectives.
112032	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right. Thanks. So Paul, when shall we have this, err, appraisal?
118990	<strong>Paul<br></strong>If you've time, we could make a start now?
122053	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh OK. So I need to think about my performance first?
127600	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Exactly. What has gone well for you this year?
131900	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well I guess I've just done my job.
136504	<strong>Narrator  <br></strong>Anna! This is your chance to sell yourself.
140100	Think about the deals you've made, the people you've managed, that sort of thing.
144879	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right. Well, I did complete two big contracts for the Imperial Lemonâ€¦
151000	<strong>Paul<br></strong>You've had plenty of compliments for that. You seem to have a zest for selling!
156900	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Err, rightâ€¦ and then there was dealing with Mr Ingle in the warehouse.
163800	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Yes, that's a good example of dealing with difficult staff. And what didn't go so well?
170800	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Wellâ€¦ ermâ€¦ working with Rachelâ€¦ and cold calling I suppose. That wasnâ€™t easy.
178999	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Ah yes. But you soon warmed up! And what should you do more of?
184862	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Err, ermâ€¦
187800	<strong>Narrator   <br></strong>It's a tricky question Anna â€“ but don't be ashamed about admitting things that you feel you could improve on.
194900	Nobody's perfect! Think about skills you'd like to improve.
199600	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh OK. Well Paul, I guess I couldâ€¦ develop some ideas for new products?
207200	Continue to work on the European marketing strategy...sell more Imperial Lemonsâ€¦ errâ€¦
214600	<strong>Paul<br></strong>That's enough Anna! If you do all that, you'll put me out of a job!
218900	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, I don't want to do that!
221100	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Now let's look ahead and set some objectives. Biscuit?
227100	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Biscuits as an objective? Oh I seeâ€¦no thanks.
232848	<strong>Paul     <br></strong>We've all got to improve our sales targets so I'm asking all the team to make an extra ten sales deals this year.
242800	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, ten, thatâ€™s a lot.
246500	<strong>Paul<br></strong>It is - but I know you can do it.
249300	And you mentioned developing new products, well I'd like you to do just that â€“ but not plastic fruit, I'd like you to develop a plastic vegetable.
260100	Potato, carrot, that sort of thing.
262812	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Gosh...Well, OK.
265600	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Oh and one more thing. Could you help Denise sort out the stationery cupboard? It's a right mess.
275300	<strong>Narrator   <br></strong>That's a lot of objectives for Anna. She's got her work cut out for the next year.
280900	Appraisals are a good time to review your work and plan what you are going to do next.
286800	Here's a reminder of the kind of questions your manager may ask you:<br><em>What has gone well for you this year?
293900	Give me some examples.
296102	<em>What didn't go so well?
299300	<em>What should you do more of?
301777	<em>Let's look ahead and set some objectives.
310318	<strong>Paul<br></strong>So if you could write up your appraisal and have it back to me by Friday?
315400	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Of course Paul. Thanks. See you later.
319802	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh hi Anna. Are you still on for dinner on Friday?
324076	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes Tom!
327301	What's going on?!
328401	<strong>Denise   <br></strong>A mouseâ€¦ a mouse! I've just seen a mouse running out of the stationery office.
333400	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Was he stealing the pens?!
334800	<strong>Denise    <br></strong>It's no joke. Quickâ€¦there he goes!
337288	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Leave him to me! Ohâ€¦ oww!
340941	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tomâ€¦ Tom? Are you ok?
344600	<strong>Narrator   <br></strong>Uh oh! Whatâ€™s happened to Tom? Has he broken something?
349310	Join us next time to find out. Bye!
