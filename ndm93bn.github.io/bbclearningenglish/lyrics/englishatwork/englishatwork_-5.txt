1	(Introduction...)
5102	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading where everyone is gossiping about Paulâ€™s announcement.
11166	Anna is to lead the companyâ€™s new stock management system for the new laser-curved fruit.
17207	(Denise on phone)
18090	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Yes Annaâ€¦the new girlâ€¦sheâ€™s done really well although I donâ€™t know what experience sheâ€™s gotâ€¦.
26006	anyway, about the hairdresser you mentioned, oh I loved his aftershaveâ€¦
32713	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I canâ€™t understand it. Iâ€™ve got all the experience and all the ideasâ€¦sheâ€™s just such aâ€¦
40005	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Tom. Sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to check youâ€™re ok with me leading this strategy for stock management.
46746	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh of course. Yeah, you deserve it.
49989	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>That was a nice touch Anna.
52750	<strong>Anna<br></strong>But Tom, now you must help me.
55759	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Eh?!
56542	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna! Thatâ€™s not the best way to ask for help.
59978	Remember what Iâ€™ve always told you about politeness?
63269	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Be polite â€“ yes you keep telling me that.
66545	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>And if you want someone to help you, ask them, donâ€™t tell them â€“ even if it is Tom!
71850	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh right. Iâ€™m in a bit of a panic.
75177	Iâ€™ve never done this before. I donâ€™t know where to begin.
79361	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well start by asking your colleagues for help like this:<br>I would be most grateful if you could give me some help<br>Please could I ask you for some advice?
89613	I know youâ€™re busy but could you spare me a few minutes of your time please?
94544	Go on, give it a try!
97903	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right, thanks. I'll try.
100409	Erm, excuse me Tom. Sorry about earlier.
104952	Iâ€™m a little nervous about leading this strategy thing and I would be most grateful if you could give me some helpâ€¦ please?
113461	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Of course Anna. Why didnâ€™t you say, Iâ€™d be delighted.
118327	Iâ€™ve lost count of the number of projects Iâ€™ve lead over the years.
121787	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Great, thanks. Soâ€¦ where do you think I should begin?
126791	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Well, give me a few minutes and Iâ€™ll just find some of the excellent work I did last year.
132567	Basically, youâ€™ll just need to copy it. Hold onâ€¦
136177	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Ah Annaâ€¦ just popping out for some biscuitsâ€¦ err, howâ€™s the stock management strategy coming along?
143302	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh very good Paulâ€¦ actually, please could I ask you for some advice, please?
149502	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Yes of courseâ€¦ although I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be much use!
153410	<strong>Tom<br></strong>â€¦ now where did I save those damn documents?â€¦
156960	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Iâ€™m very grateful for this opportunity but Iâ€™m a little unsure of where to start.
162728	Tom is looking for some his old work butâ€¦
165680	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Really?! To be honest, this isnâ€™t Tomâ€™s speciality.
169104	At a time like this I would ask Denise.
172073	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Denise!?
173044	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Yesâ€¦ she may only be the office assistant but she always has words of wisdom.
178665	Rightâ€¦ custard creams or chocolate digestives?
182011	<strong>Anna<br></strong>What?
182741	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Biscuits?
183903	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Ohâ€¦ custard creams please.
190668	Err, Denise, I know youâ€™re busy but could you spare a few minutes of your time please?
196789	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Of course Anna, always happy to help you.
200326	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well you know the stock management control system?
203138	<strong>Denise<br></strong>The one youâ€™ve now got to work outâ€¦ well done for getting that!
207486	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Thanks. It was OK writing it down for Paul but how do I put it in to practice?
213752	Thereâ€™s just too much to do!
216135	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Calm down Anna. Youâ€™ll be fine.
219152	The first thing you need to do is to look at our current system.
223479	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Look at our current system. How do I do that?
227400	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Easy! Just take the lift down to the warehouse and speak to Mr Ingle and then write down what you find â€“ and draw up an action plan of tasks you need to do â€“ like a shopping list â€“ Iâ€™m very good at those.
241983	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Go and see Mr Ingle? Oh do I have to.
247303	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Heâ€™s ok really Anna.
249943	If you approach him in the right way he wonâ€™t bite your head off!
254239	<strong>Anna<br></strong>What? Bite my head off!
256447	Ohâ€¦ well, if he wonâ€™t bite meâ€¦ then I suppose I should go and see him.
262582	Thanks for your advice Denise, I could kiss you.
266443	Right, Iâ€™m going to go and see him right now.
274473	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Make an action plan! A good idea.
277975	Well done Denise, youâ€™re smarter than you look!
280834	And well done Anna, you eventually got the help you needed by using these phrases:
286609	I would be most grateful if you could give me some help<br>Please could I ask you for some advice?
294424	I know youâ€™re busy but could you spare me a few minutes of your time please?
300725	Remember, if youâ€™re stuck for ideas just ask for helpâ€¦but maybe not Tom, I wonder how heâ€™s getting on?
307856	<strong>Tom<br></strong>(shouting across room) Here Anna, Iâ€™ve got them.
309946	Look, all my ideas from my last stock control projectâ€¦pages and pages of them.
314825	Just copy these, theyâ€™re brilliant. Anna? Anna!
319384	<strong>Paul<br></strong>â€¦too late, Iâ€™ve just seen her in the lift. Fancy a custard cream Tom?
323801	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>So Anna is off to speak to the prickly Mr Ingle.
327874	Letâ€™s hope she uses those phrases to ask for help, otherwise she might get her head bitten off â€“ and it could get very messy!
335272	See you next time.
336511	<h3>Listening challenge - answer</h3> <br>What does Denise advise Anna to do first when planning the stock management strategy? <br>To look at the current system.
