4618	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Hello, it's a chilly start to the day at Tip Top Trading.
10085	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Hi Denise!
11450	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Good morning Anna.
12925	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Brrr...it's so cold in here.
15931	<strong>Denise<br></strong>The window was left open overnight.
18618	<strong>Anna<br></strong>My papers have been blown everywhere.
21086	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Mine too! Tom was the last one here last night â€“ it must've been him who left the window open.
27455	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Brrr. Right then, to work!
30102	Oh, there's a note from Paul, it must've fallen off my desk: 'I would like your ideas on our stock management system for our new laser-curve fruit range, so we know we can keep up with demand.
44972	Please write me a couple of pages of suggestions and leave it on my desk.
50212	I'll be back this afternoon.
52606	Wow! I have to come up with ideas for a stock management system!
57677	Gosh, where do I begin?!
63059	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Good morning.
64551	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Morning!
65411	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Hey, my certificate for Plastic Pear Salesman of the Year is on the floor!
71113	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Right...stock management systems.
74653	stock-up on your laser-curved lemons â€¦ My first idea is to calculate the totalâ€¦.
86092	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well, Anna has finished her report and left it on Paul's desk, but things aren't that simple.
92052	Er, Anna, there's going to be a problem.
94460	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh? A problem, bbbbutâ€¦
97900	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Let me teach you some phrases you might need to explain that there's been a mistake:<br>I think there's been a misunderstanding.
105964	Or: There's been a bit of a mix-up.
108544	<strong>Anna<br></strong>But what misunderstanding? What mix-up?
112514	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>You could also use:<br>Let me explain what happened.
116490	<strong>Anna<br></strong>But-
117670	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Ah, good afternoon everyone.
120565	<strong>All<br></strong>Hello.
121945	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Tom, this is an excellent piece of work!
125578	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Sorry?
126754	<strong>Paul<br></strong>These are by far the best ideas you've ever had.
131101	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I don't understand.
133387	<strong>Paul</strong>Our stock management system!
135372	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Can I see? â€¦ Oh, that's not mine.
140141	<strong>Paul<br></strong>Eh?
140843	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I think there's been a misunderstanding. I did it.
144772	<strong>Paul and Tom<br></strong>You?
146143	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I got your note Paul, here.
149262	<strong>Paul<br></strong>No, no, that note was for Tom.
152258	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh, then there's been a bit of a mix-up.
156069	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Did you take that note from my desk?
158110	<strong>Anna<br></strong>No, no!
159324	<strong>Tom<br></strong>I suppose you threw my pear salesman certificate on the floor at the same time too!
163897	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I didnâ€™t! Let me explain.
166690	The wind must have blown the note for Tom under my desk.
170717	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Tom left the window open overnight.
173338	Our papers were blown all over the place.
176645	<strong>Paul<br></strong>I see, well, golly gosh.
179799	In that case, well done, Anna!
181864	Excellent work, even though you weren't meant to do it.
185129	And Tom, your ideas are still welcome of course. Thanks.
190436	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Sorry Tom.
191798	<strong>Tom<br></strong>What? Oh, I'm not bothered.
194659	I've still got some great ideas in my head anyway.
197878	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Yeah, right!
199348	Let's leave Tom to get on with his 'great ideas' and listen again those phrases Anna used to explain the misunderstanding: <br>I think there's been a misunderstanding.
210527	There's been a bit of a mix-up.
212662	Let me explain what happened.
215675	Well, the mix-up gave Anna a chance to shine â€“ Paul certainly seemed impressed with her work.
221772	Maybe it will bring her new opportunities. Until next time, bye!
