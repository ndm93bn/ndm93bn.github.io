1	(Introduction...)
4500	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Welcome back to Tip Top Trading where things aren't going too well.
9122	Anna negotiated a deal with a client in France but now they claim they've been ripped off!
15706	This has got to get sorted â€“ quickly.
18750	<strong>Anna  <br></strong>Oh Denise, what exactly did they say?
22555	<strong>Denise</strong> <br>Something about them agreeing a price for 5,000 lemons and then being offered a better price by another company.
30600	<strong>Anna <br></strong>That'll be Tutti Fruity â€“ they want our business.
34900	<strong>Denise <br></strong>Sounds like they're going to get it, unless you sort it out. Maybe you should work out some new figures.
42100	<strong>Anna <br></strong>Figures? Is there something wrong with my figure â€“ am I too fat?
47100	<strong>Denise <br></strong>No Anna! Your numbers â€“ work out a new price, see if you can squeeze the price of lemons â€“ maybe you can price Tutti Fruity out of the market.
58050	<strong>Anna  <br></strong>Hmm, somebody else has said that.
61444	<strong>Narrator <br></strong>Yes it was me Anna! Do your calculations, see if you can offer a better deal and price Tutti Fruity out of the market.
70400	<strong>Anna</strong><br>OK. I could sell them cheaper but there would be less profit.
83473	<strong>Narrator</strong><br>Well, less profit is better than no profit.
86755	And who knows, if this goes well, it might lead to more contracts.
91513	But it's down to you now to make that call.
94444	<strong>Anna</strong><br>But what am I going to say?
96467	<strong>Narrator</strong>  <br>Be friendly and sayâ€¦ <em>I'm sorry to hear you're not happy with our price</em>.
102005	Tell them <em>Tip Top Trading prides itself on quality products and good value for money</em>.
108463	And flatter them and say they are <em>a valued customer and their business is very important to us.
115166	<strong>Anna</strong><br>And what shall I say about the price?
118374	<strong>Narrator</strong>    <br>Tell them you can match the price of our competitors.
121932	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Match the price. Right. Thanks. OK, I had better call them.
138000	<strong>Trader <br></strong>Bonjour. Fruit Traders International.
142444	<strong>Anna  <br></strong>Oh, erm, hello, is that Monsieur Brown?
147050	<strong>Trader <br></strong>Oui. Yes.
148900	<strong>Anna  <br></strong>This is Annaâ€¦ from Tip Top Trading. I was sorry to receive your message.
154778	<strong>Trader <br></strong>Yes, well. I thought we were doing good business and then another company called me and offered me a much better deal.
163700	<strong>Anna  <br></strong>Yes, I understand. Iâ€™m sorry to hear you're not happy with our priceâ€¦ but hopefully we can sort something out?
172100	<strong>Trader <br></strong>Oh yes?
173100	<strong>Anna  <br></strong>You are a valued customer and your business is very important to usâ€¦ and we would love to see our Imperial Lemons on display in the restaurants and shops of France.
186999	<strong>Narrator <br></strong>That's a nice touch Anna, well done!
190400	<strong>Trader <br></strong>So?
191900	<strong>Anna  <br></strong>So, I've done some calculations and we can offer you a better price.
198588	<strong>Trader <br></strong>But Tutti Fruity can offer us a good price.
202588	<strong>Anna  <br></strong>I'm sure they can butâ€¦ weâ€¦ weâ€¦
206500	<strong>Narrator <br></strong>Yes Anna?
207600	<strong>Anna   <br></strong>â€¦at Tip Top Trading we pride ourselves on quality products and good value and I think we can match Tutti Fruity's priceâ€¦ in fact I know we can beat it.
219800	<strong>Trader <br></strong>I see. That's good to hear butâ€¦
222666	<strong>Anna <br></strong>We'll give you an extra 10% discount â€“ but obviously we would like you to make a bigger order.
229222	<strong>Trader <br></strong>Oh, a bigger order. I will have to have a think about this.
233000	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, of course, but please let me know as soon as you can before someone else snaps up this offer.
239480	Merci. Au revoir.
241000	<strong>Trader <br></strong>Ah, merci, au revoir.
247444	<strong>Narrator <br></strong>Excellent work Anna! I can see why she's got the job now. But will her sales tactics pay off?
255100	Let's remind ourselves of some of the great lines that Anna used in trying to resolve a tricky sales dealâ€¦
262127	<em>I'm sorry to hear you're not happy with our price.
265864	<em>Tip Top Trading prides itself on quality products and good value for money.
271582	You are a valued customer and your business is very important to us.
277900	<em>We can match the price of our competitors.
286000	<strong>Denise</strong><br>Well done Anna. It looks like you may have saved that deal.
291200	<strong>Paul</strong> <br>Saved the deal? Is there a problem?
294317	<strong>Anna</strong> <br>Well, Tutti Fruity has tried to undercut our price but I think I may have saved the deal we had with International Fruit Traders in France.
304333	<strong>Denise</strong><br>Yes, Anna offered a lower price for a bigger order and they're having a think about it.
311901	<strong>Paul</strong> <br>Crumbs. If the deal's not complete I think you need to get out to France and seal the deal.
318430	I want you and Tom to fly out there as soon as possible and do some schmoozing.
323323	<strong>Denise</strong><br>Oh! You and Tom hey?
326100	<strong>Narrator</strong><br>That's enough Denise! This should be fun.
330328	Find out what happens next time on English at Work. Bye.
