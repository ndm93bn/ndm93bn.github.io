1	(Introduction...)
16305	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>It's late at the offices of Tip Top Trading.
19814	Anna is alone, working. Again.
23427	She's been doing this all week, she wants her presentation to Mr Lime to be perfect so she's been spending hours and hours on it.
32817	Anna?
33450	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Don't interrupt! I'm busy.
35662	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Woah!
36374	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Sorry.
37317	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna, you're really burning the candle at both ends.
40638	<strong>Anna<br></strong>What?
41215	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Burning the candle at both ends â€“ it means working very hard â€“ working late and getting up early to work all the time.
49666	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Oh. I didn't know that expression.
51819	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Well here are some more: <br>You're doing overtime; which means you're working longer than office hours.
58494	You're putting in the hours; which means you are spending all the time needed to achieve something.
64967	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Yes, I'm putting in the hours to make sure my presentation is perfect.
69353	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>And if you don't mind me saying so, you might burn out; which means you are working so hard that you might get very tired and run out of energy.
78019	<strong>Anna<br></strong>I'm not burning out.
79870	I'm full of energy.
81784	I just need to finish this bit.
92195	<strong>Denise<br></strong>My goodness, nothing's locked. Do you think we've been burgled?
97407	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Oh no! I left my lap-book and my me-pad on the desk.
102050	and my i-top â€“ they're worth thousands!
105359	They're all the latest versions!
106895	<strong>Denise<br></strong>I left out my elephant mug and my lady-curve nail file.
111855	They better not have stolen them!
113679	<strong>Anna<br></strong>(Talking in her sleep) but it's premium, premium, faux-orange premium!
122847	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna?
124161	<strong>Denise<br></strong>It's Anna, she's asleep. Anna!
128307	<strong>Anna<br></strong>(waking up with a jump) Oh! Lemons! Denise? Tom?
131614	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Have you spent the night asleep at your desk Anna?
134986	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Is it morning? Oh dear, yes I think so.
138997	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Well, at least we haven't been burgled then.
142611	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Anna, you've really been burning the candle at both ends lately.
147475	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Yes, you've been doing hours and hours of overtime.
151982	Most people get their work done within office hours and anyway, we don't pay overtime here.
158555	Youâ€™ll never find me working late!
161282	<strong>Tom<br></strong>Yes, I'd noticed that Denise.
163514	<strong>Anna<br></strong>But this presentation must be perfect.
166218	<strong>Denise<br></strong>If you're not careful, you'll burn out!
169643	Then you'll really be of no use to anyone.
174009	You'll be as useful as a chocolate teapot.
177042	<strong>Tom<br></strong>It's good that you're putting in the hours Anna, but you should calm down.
182478	Look at me, I do very successful presentations without spending hours preparing.
188603	<strong>Denise<br></strong>Ha!
189469	<strong>Tom<br></strong>In my presentation to Every Apple I just swooshed in with no preparation after a night on the town.
196603	I charmed them. They loved me!
198749	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Idiot. I bet he actually spent hours preparing he just can't admit it.
204830	<strong>Anna<br></strong>Well, maybe you're right.
206924	I can't think clearly anymore, I'm so tired.
210983	I need to sleep properly otherwise I'll end up trying to sell bananas instead of lemons.
218370	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Anna has finally got the message: she's realised she's been working too much.
224187	She needs to be realistic.
226275	Here's a reminder of some of the phrases we heard to talk about how much Anna had been working:<br>Burning the candle at both ends.
234807	Doing overtime.
237435	Putting in the hours.
239778	Burning out.
242281	Let's hope she's thinking clearly by the time she has to do her presentation.
248240	Join us next time to find out! Bye.
