12158	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14718	I'm Neilâ€¦
15230	<strong>Alice<br></strong>â€¦ and I'm Alice.
16446	Now Neil, how do you get to work?
18494	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I cycle.
19454	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I didn't know that!
20471	Somehow I hadn't imagined you as a cyclist.
23286	And where's all your bike gear?
25248	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I sneak in the mornings, have a shower, and get changed.
28278	That's my bike in the corner over there.
30155	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Oh, you've got a <strong>foldaway</strong> bike - which means it folds up so it's easy to carry or put away.
36128	Do you wear lycra, Neil?
37707	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, I doâ€¦ it's very comfortable.
39499	I wear lycra as often as I can.
41632	<strong>Lycra</strong> by the way is a stretchy fabric used in tight-fitting sports clothes.
47093	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, I'll have to see if I can catch you on your way into the building - I'm <strong>intrigued</strong> about this sporty Neil I didn't know about!
54347	<strong>Neil<br></strong>'Intrigued' means to be very interested in something.
57803	Well, Alice, I'm flattered.
59851	And today's show is about <strong>commuting</strong> - or travelling between your home and your work.
64800	So how did you commute this morning, Alice?
67360	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I got the <strong>Tube</strong> - that's the subway system here in London, also known as the underground - and it was a nightmare.
74741	We stopped in a tunnel for so long that people started talking to each other.
78944	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And for those of you who aren't Londoners, that's unusual!
83040	Do you ever talk to people on the train?
84853	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No.
85471	People think you're crazy if you talk to strangers.
88266	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, maybe now's a good time to talk about today's quiz question, Alice.
92938	What question do you have for me?
94623	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Alright then.
95477	I know you like my questions, Neil.
97290	So here we go: What did the word 'commuter' originally describe?
102943	Was it someone whoâ€¦ <br>a) travelled with other people?
107167	<br>b) paid a reduced fare to travel?
109962	<br>Or c) travelled by train to work?
113140	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, that's easy.
114015	I'm going to go for c) travelled by train to work.
117364	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out later whether you're right or not.
120628	Now let's listen to a commuter in Nairobi who takes a matatu to get to work.
126282	These are minibuses used as shared taxis in East Africa.
130441	Can you spot a word that means being quick to notice things going on around you?
135625	<strong>INSERT<br>Commuter, Nairobi, Kenya<br></strong>When I'm stuck in the matatu there is a lot of strange things happen around you, so you have to be alert in Nairobi.
146249	When you openâ€¦ when you leave your window open somebody can run away with your belongings.
152585	You may be speakingâ€¦ using the phoneâ€¦ somebody just snatch your phoneâ€¦ you may expect the unexpected!
160073	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The word used by this commuter in Kenya is <strong>alert</strong>.
167860	And in these noisy, crowded buses you need to be alert in case someone runs away with your belongings - <strong>belongings</strong> are the things that you own.
176179	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Right.
176905	Somebody might snatch your phone - <strong>snatch</strong> means to take something quickly.
181811	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Public transport in Nairobi sounds stressful!
184627	If I was taking the bus I'd want to have a <strong>nap</strong> - or short sleep.
188041	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
188766	Well, people have done research on commuting and stress levels - and interestingly women are more likely to experience stress during their journey than men.
197939	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Why's that?
198984	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, they're more likely to do something which is being called 'trip chaining' - where they make one or more stops on the way to work or going home - for example to drop off or pick up the kids from school - and this makes it more likely that something will go wrong with their journey.
215219	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Even if you aren't trip chaining it's no fun being stuck in a <strong>traffic jam</strong> - that's a large number of vehicles â€‹close together â€‹moving â€‹slowly - or being packed into a crowded train like sardines.
226568	Let's face it - travelling by car or by public transport can be really miserable!
231347	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
231944	<strong> Packed in like sardines</strong> describes people standing so close together that they can't move - like fish in a can!
239304	So let's hear how longer commutes can affect your health from US researcher Christine Hoehner.
246493	<strong>INSERT<br>Christine Hoehner, researcher at Washington University School of Medicine<br></strong>My study found that adults who commuted longer distances from home to work were less physically active, less physically fit, weighed more and had higher blood pressure than those people who had shorter commutes.
261063	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The American researcher must be talking about commuters who aren't engaged in active travel, mustn't she?
268359	Because if you cycle a longer distance then you're being more physically active.
273010	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I think you're right, for once, Neil!
275719	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah.
276445	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And I'd better start going to the gym more.
278834	I don't like the sound of high blood pressure.
281223	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Why don't you hop on your bike, Alice?
283442	Then we can both wear lycra to work.
285660	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's a fantastic idea, Neil!
288690	Moving on!
289522	Here's the answer to today's quiz question.
292892	I asked: What did the word 'commuter' originally describe?
297543	Was it someone whoâ€¦ a) travelled with other people?
301660	b) paid a reduced fare to travel?
304689	Or c) travelled by train to work?
307889	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said c) travelled by train to work.
311089	It must be right.
311921	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And you were wrong I'm afraid, Neil!
314353	It's b) someone who paid a reduced fare to travel.
318791	The Oxford Dictionary says the word 'commute' comes from from Latin <em>commutare</em>, from <em>com-</em> 'altogether' + <em>mutare</em> 'to change'.
328284	The word was used in the US in the 1840s, when people paid a reduced or <strong>commuted</strong> fare to travel by rail from the suburbs into the city.
337436	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK.
338033	Can you tell us the words we heard today again, Alice?
340572	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Of course I can.
341446	Here they are:<br>foldaway bike<br>lycra<br>intrigued<br>commuting<br>the Tube<br>alert<br>belongings<br>snatch<br>nap<br>traffic jam<br>packed in like sardines<br>commuted
364678	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's journey with 6 Minute English.
368262	Please do join us again soon.
369542	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.
