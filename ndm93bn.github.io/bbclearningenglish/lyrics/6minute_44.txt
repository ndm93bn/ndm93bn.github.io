1	(Introduction...)
11777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic and bring you six bits of useful vocabulary. I'm Neil.
20162	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And I'm Rob. Today we're talking about <strong>first impressions</strong> - and how they're often wrong.
25200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So let's start with the term <strong>first impression </strong>- it's the idea or opinion you have about someone after meeting them for only a short time.
33800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's very natural to make a quick judgement about someone based on their appearance or facial expression.
39599	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We're going to be hearing about the research of Professor Alexander Todorov from Princeton University in the US.
46111	First, a question: how long does he say it takes to form an impression about someone's face?
52500	Is it. <br>a) under one second <br>b) one second <br>c) six seconds
58493	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I'll go for b) one second.
60886	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or not at the end of the programme.
64100	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So - Alexander Todorov has been researching our impressions.
68000	His tests asked people to decide whether they thought faces were dominant, competent, <strong>trustworthy</strong> or <strong>extroverted</strong>.
75860	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Let's just look at those words for a second. Dominant means being strongest or most important. Competent means being able to do things.
84419	<strong>Rob<br></strong>While if you're <strong>trustworthy</strong> it means people trust you - you are worth their trust.
89200	And being extroverted means you are energetic and enjoy spending time with others.
94333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So what did he find out? Faces that look happy and feminine - like a woman - were rated as more <strong>trustworthy</strong>.
101850	<strong>Rob<br></strong>While faces that were more masculine - like a man - were seen as more dominant.
106400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Wider faces with big eyes were seen as more <strong>extroverted</strong>.
110200	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now the important thing that Todorov says is that these judgements <em>aren't</em> accurate. Someone who looks competent isn't necessarily competent!
118333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, what does this mean in practice? Here's Professor Todorov:
121866	<strong>Professor Alexander Todorov, Princeton University<br></strong><strong>Trustworthiness</strong>, dominance and attractiveness are the three big things that we form impressions of people.
129280	But interestingly we have done some work predicting the electoral success of politicians, and the judgement that is most predictive of who is going to win the election is <strong>perceived</strong> competence.
140500	And this is not random at all, because if you ask voters what is the most important <strong>attribute</strong> of a politician, competence is the one on the top.
151100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, so this is actually quite significant. People say that the most important <strong>attribute</strong> - or quality - for a politician is competence - the ability to do things.
161455	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That sounds fair enough. But because we make judgements based on appearance - this can actually affect how people vote.
169100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>If voters believe - or <strong>perceive</strong> someone to be competent - they're more likely to vote for him or her.
175200	<strong>Rob<br></strong>He says this applies especially to people who are less educated about politics - they are more likely to be influenced by appearance.
183599	<strong>Neil<br></strong>He says this applies to around 25% of voters - so the number of people who <strong>go with their gut</strong> is large enough to influence the outcomes of elections!
193155	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Wow. <strong>To go with</strong> <strong>your gut</strong>. That means to make a decision which isn't based on rational thought - it's based on instinct, on a feeling, on your gut.
203444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes - your gut is your stomach and the organs in your belly. So, can we tell nothing from a person's face?
210600	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Todorov says faces carry useful information about things like a person's mental state, and whether they're tired or sick. But they don't tell you about a person's character.
220399	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Indeed. It's not only elections where this counts, we also judge during job interviews and meetings.
226400	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So what can we do to minimise the chances of being affected - should we just close our eyes when we meet people?
232711	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, it's not such a bad idea!
242555	They then introduced 'blind auditions' in other words they listened to new musicians without looking at them.
249000	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And what happened - I guess many more women were selected?
252722	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly - around 50%. Of course, gender and race are also huge factors in how we perceive faces.
259333	Todorov says we tend to react most positively to faces that look like our own.
264333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Right, well - I guess we just need to take a deep breath and try not to judge too much.
269333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Easier said than done, I'm afraid. Especially when we judge so quickly!
273399	But do we do it in under a second, one second or six seconds?
278111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I said one second.
279888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>According to Todorov it takes under one second.
283444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I think it's safe to say it's very fast. So shall we <em>quickly</em> go through today's vocabulary?
289333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Ok - first up: <strong>first impression</strong> - the first judgement you make about something.
293800	What was your <strong>first impression</strong> of me, Rob?
296600	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well I thought you were very <strong>trustworthy</strong> and <strong>extroverted.
300444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well isn't that convenient, (and accurate?!), because those were exactly the two adjectives I wanted to look at next.
307552	Being <strong>trustworthy</strong> is important in life - it means people trust you.
311222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And being <strong>extroverted</strong> is more of a character type - <strong>extroverts</strong> like to be with people, and are often seen as confident - whereas the opposite - introverts, usually need to spend time on their own, and aren't as loud.
324444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Both of these are interesting <strong>attributes </strong>- or qualities.
327682	You could say that mathematical ability is an essential <strong>attribute</strong> for an engineer.
332555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And competence is the number one attribute for a politician.
336208	Although people don't always vote depending on actual competence, they base it on their <strong>perception</strong>.
342200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>What they see, or <strong>perceive</strong>, as competence.
345000	'<strong>Perceived</strong> competence' might be different from actual competence!
348555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, in many situations we tend to <strong>go with our guts</strong>.
352400	We make decisions based on deep feelings. Do you do that, Neil?
356300	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, some things you can think about too much.
358860	When I left my last job, I really just <strong>went with my gut </strong>- it felt like the right thing to do.
363299	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Of course - because it meant coming to work here with me!
366555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Naturally. So - that's it for our chat about first impressions - for more do visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website!
375818	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Bye for now.
376699	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye!
