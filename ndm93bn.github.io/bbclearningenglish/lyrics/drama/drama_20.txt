1	(Introduction...)
24700	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Yes, Mary. I planned the <strong>wrecks</strong>.
27999	Your uncle followed my <strong>orders </strong>but they thought <em>he</em> was the leader.
32666	He loved that. No one knew about me. But then you came and asked questions.
39333	<strong>They had to die because of that</strong>. The end was near in any case. The fool got drunk on Christmas Eve.
46999	Well, you saw what happened...the whole country knew what he'd done.
51999	With a rope round his neck, he'd have told them about me.
55888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>At least my uncle didn't lie - he talked and dreamt about his crimes.
61061	You... you hid yours behind the cross and the face of a priest. But why are you telling me all this now?
67690	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>I know you found the picture. I saw it had been moved. It frightened you, didn't it?
73724	"Who is this strange man?" you thought. Yes, Mary I am strange.
80444	Oh, but they listened to me in church and followed me like sheep. Now, get ready. We've got to leave.
89222	<strong>Mary<br></strong>We?!
90193	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Yes, you're coming with me - you'll be a good <strong>companion</strong>.
94111	I've admired your courage since we first met.
96888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>And if I don't come with you?
98986	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>You're no fool, Mary. There are no houses nearby and your screams won't be heard.
104600	<strong>Mary<br></strong>You know that I'll run away at the first village.
107429	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>You won't be able to.
109333	<strong>There aren't any villages on the Cornish coast because of the steep cliffs</strong>...just birds, and when we're on the ship.
117000	<strong>Mary<br></strong>You're leaving England?
118666	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Of course - we'll go to Spain, to Africa. Get ready now.
126444	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I think quickly. I look at the clock. Jem will have reached the <strong>blacksmith</strong> and will know the truth.
133900	<strong>He'll realise I'm in serious danger so he will follow us</strong>.
138114	If I go with the vicar, at least I'll slow him down a bit, so Jem will have a chance to catch up.
144888	I have no choice in any case.
148800	We cross the dark, empty moor quickly, avoiding the roads.
153122	The moon is hidden behind clouds. The Vicar has luck on his side.
159900	As the ground becomes softer, we slow down. The <strong>marshes</strong> lie waiting.
166666	The Vicar knows, as I do, that <strong>one wrong step will result in a horrible death</strong>.
174555	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh, where is Jem?
177666	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Whoah!
180766	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>A wall of fog rises in front of us.
184666	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>It's no good. We can't see anything. We'll have to wait until light.
190666	We'll sleep here...on these rocks, out of the wind.
194311	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I <strong>drift in and out</strong> of sleep.
197777	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Shhh! Be quiet!
200777	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I'm woken by his cold hand on my mouth.
205888	I can still hear the wind, but there is something else, too.
212900	We leave the horses and he <strong>drags </strong>me higher and higher.
220555	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I can't go any further.
224111	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Stay here, then.
229878	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>The last I see of him - he's standing on a rock with his arms stretched out.
237001	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>(gunshot) Aaaah!
241000	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I look up. Jem is about 100 metres away behind a rock with a gun.
258777	I haven't seen Jem since he shot the vicar. The Bassat family have been looking after me.
265264	They've asked me to stay and look after their children.
269800	but I <strong>long for</strong> the green fields and valleys of Helford.
273888	I'm walking for the last time on the moor.
277780	Tomorrow I'll go back and live quietly on the farm.
289418	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Someone is coming this way...but I can't see who because the sun is in my eyes.
294888	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Hello Mary. I heard you're going to go and live at North Hill?
299986	<strong>Mary<br></strong>They've asked me, but no. I'm going back to Helford tomorrow. And you, are you leaving Cornwall?
309222	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Yes, I'm going to start a new life.
312999	I've got my whole home with me here. I may go north.
316710	Perhaps I'll <strong>breed</strong> horses instead of stealing them. Come with me, Mary.
322500	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I miss my home in Helford. I want to see the trees and animals.
327900	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Go then and live on your farm.
329753	<strong>Mary<br></strong>That's not very kind.
331697	<strong>Jem<br></strong>I speak unkindly to my horses when they're <strong>obstinate</strong>...it doesn't mean I don't love them.
338333	Well, I'll be on my way. Goodbye Mary.
345424	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Wait! Are you saying you love me?
351999	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Maybe. It'll be a hard life.
356180	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I know, I'll take my chance...and we'll be together.
366555	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>So, I cross the moor for the last time - and for the first time, it looks beautiful in the sunshine.
378333	Behind me lies Jamaica Inn, empty, no more secrets - they have all been told...my new life is about to begin.
