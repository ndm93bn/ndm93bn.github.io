1	(Introduction...)
27800	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>It's day 61 - and it's a miracle! I didn't hit any rocks and we're safe in the harbour at Papeete on the island of Tahiti.
38800	It's just a quick stop to clean up the yacht and take on fresh water.
44200	<strong>I'm going to find</strong> one more souvenir to take home as part of my challenge - some type of musical instrument - hmmm.
52500	And how are my travelling companions?
55900	Well, they're not under the weather anymore - I mean, they aren't feeling ill - they've recovered from the food poisoning that I unfortunately gave them - but strangely, they still seem very pleased with me.
76600	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>'Aloha' Phil! There you are, we were looking for you.
81089	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Hi. I thought you two should rest, so I went off to buy something.
86000	Look, I've bought a 'pahu' - it's a traditional Tahitian drum.
90376	I need some kind of exotic instrument as part of my challenge - so here we go.
97800	And my credit card works here, so I've bought us all some colourful Polynesian shirts - don't they look great?
105200	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Brilliant - Ilove the palm trees.
107900	<strong>PP<br></strong>I suppose I could wear it at sea where nobody could see me.
112407	<strong>Phil<br></strong>And I've got some food for Peggy. Now look you two, I'm really sorry about the lobsters and.
118580	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Be quiet Phil! In fact, well done - you're my hero.
123555	You did really well sailing the yacht all by yourself.
127400	Look, I found this old captain's hat the back of a drawer in the galley - go on Phil, put it on. You're in charge now!
133700	You're in charge now! Let me take a photograph. I'm going to put that on Facebook.
139900	<strong>PP<br></strong>Yes, well done old chap. You've proved me wrong - you're not as useless as you look!
146093	Just don't cook us any more of your 'special meals'.
149700	<strong>Phil<br></strong>OK, I'll stick to making the tea.
152600	<strong>PP<br></strong>Perhaps you could sail us home now?
154900	<strong>Phil<br></strong>I think we should work together as a team.
158600	I'd love to stay here for longer - it's so beautiful... but we have a job to do.
164984	We need to set sail and head for the Panama Canal.
168806	<strong>PP and Sophia<br></strong>Aye-aye, captain!
170900	<strong>PP<br></strong>He's not really in charge, is he?
176600	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Day 65 and we've had the wind in our sails. We're now passing through the Panama Canal.
184823	It's an incredible construction and luckily for us saves us thousands of kilometres of sailing around South America.
192808	We're not cheating - we are still sailing around the world - but will we do it in 80 days? My companions seem quite confident.
207111	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Phil, <strong>what are you going to spend all the money on when you get home</strong>?
211034	<strong>PP<br></strong>Maybe you could pay me a bit more? Or buy a few more drinks in the pub?
216901	<strong>Phil<br></strong>I haven't thought about it and anyway, we've got to win this race first, which is looking very unlikely.
224600	But I <strong>am going to write</strong> about our adventures and I hope that this time, someone will buy my book.
231319	What about you Sophia, <strong>what are you going to do</strong>?
235238	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>I really don't know. I sold everything to pay for my trip.
240022	I'm going to have to find somewhere to live as soon as I get back to the UK.
244100	<strong>PP<br></strong>Don't worry Sophia. Phil has a sofa you can sleep on! There's room for that parrot too.
250700	And <strong>I'm going to start</strong> looking for a new job as soon as we get home - Captain of the QE2 maybe?
258585	<strong>Phil<br></strong>Ah look, we're finally out of the canal. This must be the Caribbean Sea.
265194	It's beautiful and it's calm too - there aren't any waves. Look, it looks like a swimming pool.
273500	<strong>PP<br></strong>That's because there's no wind. We'll have to use the engine for a while until the wind gets up.
281900	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>Day 71 - it's windy. Very, very windy.
288500	A radio message has warned us of a hurricane heading our way. The sea is already getting rough.
296300	It's time to batten down the hatches and prepare for another very bumpy ride. I'm getting quite used to this!
310800	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>This is wild! We've got to change course - find some shelter.
316100	<strong>PP<br></strong>Yes, you're right. Our sails will just rip to pieces in this weather.
320555	<strong>Phil<br></strong>No - I think we should carry on. We've been in worse seas than this.
326100	And we can't waste any more time. Come on everyone, we can't let this little storm beat us.
333200	<strong>We're going to get through this</strong>.
335000	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Are you feeling ok Phil?
337228	<strong>Phil<br></strong>I'm feeling great.
344408	<strong>Phil<br></strong><em>For once I feel like I know what I'm doing. I'm not scared.
348900	I've got Passepartout, Sophia and our lucky parrot Peggy with me -and that makes me think <strong>everything is going to be ok</strong>. I hope I'm right!
365700	<strong>PP<br></strong>OK Phil, maybe it's the captain's hat - but you really are a changed man. Come on then, let's ride this storm.
373300	<strong>Sophia<br></strong>Hold on tight - there's a huge wave coming.
376300	<strong>All<br></strong>Whoooahhhh!
