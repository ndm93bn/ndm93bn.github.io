1	(Introduction...)
13444	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Gwendolen and Cecily are angry with Jack and Algernon now they know their real names - neither of them are called Ernest.
23577	The two women are inside the house. The men come in trying to look and sound cheerful.
31666	<strong>Jack and Algernon<br></strong>[whistling Daisy, Daisy]
36222	<strong>Gwendolen</strong><br>I'm sure they're feeling sorry. Let's not say anything.
39888	<strong>Cecily</strong><br>Certainly not. Mr Moncrieff, why did you pretend to be my <strong>guardian</strong>'s brother?
45900	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>So that I had the opportunity to meet you.
48444	<strong>Cecily</strong><br>That seems a satisfactory explanation, doesn't it Gwendolen?
52555	<strong>Gwendolen</strong><br>Yes, if you can believe him.
54822	<strong>Cecily</strong><br>I don't. But his answer was so beautiful.
58163	<strong>Gwendolen</strong><br>True. In matters of great importance, it's style, not truth that is essential.
64145	Mr Worthing, why did you pretend to have a brother? Was it so you could come to London to see me?
69855	<strong>Jack</strong><br>Do you have any doubts, dear Gwendolen?
72444	<strong>Gwendolen</strong><br>I have serious doubts. But I intend to ignore them. Cecily, should we forgive them?
78000	<strong>Cecily</strong><br>Yes. I mean no. <strong>Probably</strong> not. What about their names?
83888	<strong>Gwendolen</strong><br>True! I had forgotten!
85888	<strong>Gwendolen</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Cecily</strong><br>Your names are still a huge problem!
89222	<strong>Jack</strong> <strong>and Algernon</strong><br>Our names! Is that all?
92195	But we are going to be <strong>christened </strong>with a different name this afternoon.
96700	<strong>Gwendolen</strong><br>You are prepared to do this terrible thing for me, Jack?
100078	<strong>Jack</strong><br>I am.
101539	<strong>Cecily</strong><br>To please me you are ready to face this awful experience, Algernon?
106444	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>I am!
107666	<strong>Gwendolen</strong><br>How can people talk about the equality of the sexes!
111222	Men have moments of physical <strong>courage</strong> which we women know <strong>absolutely</strong> nothing about.
116999	<strong>Cecily</strong><br>Jack, darling!
119222	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>Cecily, darling!
121222	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>And they fall into each other's arms.
125333	Merriman comes in and coughs <strong>loudly</strong>. He announces a visitor.
131136	<strong>Merriman</strong><br> Lady Bracknell!
132900	<strong>Jack</strong><br>Good heavens!
135900	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>Gwendolen! What does this mean?
139666	<strong>Gwendolen</strong><br><strong>Simply</strong> that I am engaged to Mr Worthing, mamma.
143166	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>Mr Worthing, I followed my daughter by train.
146458	Gwendolen is meant to be attending a university lecture. Well, that is what her father thinks.
152900	All communication between yourself and my daughter must end <strong>immediately</strong>.
158111	<strong>Jack</strong><br>We are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell!
161222	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>You are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, what about Algernon! Algernon!
166055	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>Yes, Aunt Augusta.
167555	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>May I ask if it is in this house that your sick friend Mr Bunbury lives?
173323	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>Oh! No! Bunbury doesn't live here.
176922	Bunbury is somewhere else at the moment.
179111	In fact, Bunbury is dead.
181999	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>Dead! When did he die?
184777	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon. I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.
190000	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>He died so <strong>suddenly</strong>? What did he die of?
193000	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>I mean he was discovered! The doctors discovered that he could not live, so he died.
198200	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>He seems to have had great <strong>confidence</strong> in the opinion of his doctors.
201844	I am glad that he <strong>finally</strong> made up his mind to take some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.
209777	And now, Mr Worthing, who is the young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is holding in an unnecessary way?
218777	<strong>Jack</strong><br>That is Miss Cecily Cardew, I'm her guardian.
223055	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>I am engaged to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.
225777	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>I beg your pardon?
227111	<strong>Cecily</strong><br>Mr Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.
231222	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Lady Bracknell has to sit down at this news.
234771	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>There seems to be something <strong>unusually</strong> exciting in the air - the number of engagements seems to be above average.
244222	Mr Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected with any railway stations in London?
249780	I am <strong>simply</strong> asking. Until yesterday I didn't know any families or people whose origin was a station.
257777	<strong>Jack</strong><br>Miss Cecily Cardew is the granddaughter of the <strong>late</strong> Mr Thomas Cardew of 149 Belgrave Square; Gervase Park, <strong>Surrey</strong>; and the Sporran, <strong>Fifeshire</strong>.
271000	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>Three addresses. That <strong>always</strong> gives me<strong> confidence</strong>. I am not unsatisfied.
276666	<strong>Jack</strong><br>How <strong>extremely</strong> kind of you, Lady Bracknell!
280111	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>Now Gwendolen, we have to leave.
282444	Just one thing, Mr Worthing, does Miss Cardew have any money?
286777	<strong>Jack</strong><br>Oh! About Â£130,000. That is all.
291570	Goodbye, Lady Bracknell. So pleased to have seen you.
295555	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>A moment, Mr Worthing. Â£130,000!
302666	Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.
308920	Come over here, dear. Turn round, dear child, so I can see your face.
314111	There are definite social possibilities in your face. Algernon!
319508	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>Yes, Aunt Augusta!
321222	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>There are definite social possibilities in Miss Cardew.
324700	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>I don't care about social possibilities.
327333	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>Never speak <strong>disrespectfully</strong> of Society, Algernon. Only people who can't get into it do that.
332908	Now Miss Cardew, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his <strong>debts </strong>to depend upon.
339000	But I do not approve of marriages for money. Well, I suppose I must give my <strong>consent</strong>.
345555	<strong>Algernon</strong><br>Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
347222	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>The marriage had better take place quite soon. I am not in favour of long engagements.
352000	They give people the chance to find out each other's characters before marriage - never a good thing.
357444	<strong>Jack</strong><br>I'm sorry to interrupt you, Lady Bracknell, but I am Miss Cardew's guardian, and I don't give my consent to this marriage.
366800	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>And why not may I ask? Isn't Algernon an extremely <strong>eligible</strong> young man?
372333	He has nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire?
378333	<strong>Jack</strong><br>The fact is that I do not <strong>approve</strong> of his <strong>moral</strong> character. He has not been honest.
385262	<strong>Narrator<br></strong>Algernon and Cecily look at him amazed.
388664	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>Untruthful! Algernon? Impossible!
393222	<strong>Jack</strong><br>I'm afraid there is no doubt. This afternoon he came to my house pretending to be my brother.
399621	He has succeeded in one afternoon to change the affections of dear Cecily.
404555	He then stayed to tea, and ate all the <strong>muffins</strong>.
408999	<strong>Lady Bracknell</strong><br>Ahem! Mr Worthing, after careful consideration I have decided to forgive my nephew's behaviour.
417777	<strong>Jack</strong><br>That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.
421340	However I have not changed my mind. I do not give my consent.
