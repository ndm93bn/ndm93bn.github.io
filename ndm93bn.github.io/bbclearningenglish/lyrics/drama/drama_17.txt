1	(Introduction...)
9000	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>It's morningâ€¦I have just woken up in my bed in Jamaica Inn.
15777	Memories of what I saw on Christmas Eve<strong>haunt</strong>me like a<strong>nightmare</strong>â€¦
23666	My uncle forced me to travel with him and his drunken men on Christmas Eve.
30777	I was so tired on the journey that while they were singing drunken songs, I fell asleep.
40222	<strong>When I woke up, they had gone</strong>. The carriage doors were locked, but I escaped through the window. <strong>They had brought me to the coast.</strong>
54555	It was a cold,<strong>misty</strong>night, but from where I was standing on the clifftop, I could see my uncle and his<strong>gang</strong>below on the shore, silent and still.
68666	They were watching the<strong>tide</strong>coming in, like a beast waiting to<strong>pounce</strong>.
82666	The mist began to clear and a light appeared on a nearby cliff.
87888	At last!<strong>The officers the vicar had spoken about were coming!
93000	</strong>â€¦ But my hope disappeared quickly.  Another light appeared out at sea.
99277	This one was moving up and downâ€¦ I realised then with horror what was happening.
108444	The light on the cliff was a<strong>trap</strong>! A huge black shape appeared out of the darkness.
116834	Like a<strong>moth</strong>to a candle, the ship was heading for the rocksâ€¦
122999	I remember now how I ran to the shore, how I screamed and shoutedâ€¦ but my uncle caught me and tied my hands so I couldn't move.
134333	I couldn't do anything except watch the disaster happen.
140900	<strong>Mary<br></strong>The men splashed about in the water grabbing<strong>treasures that had fallen</strong>from the ship<strong>.</strong>Bodies were floating on the water.
148777	The men fell on them and took everything of value â€¦ even rings on the fingers. Hours passed. Light was appearing in the sky. My uncle saw it too.
161888	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Whoah!! â€¦ Stop everyone! Look!
166475	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>He pointed to the sky.
168755	<strong>Harry<br></strong>Just â€¦ going â€¦to get â€¦
173222	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Leave it! â€¦ There's no time! â€¦ It's getting light â€¦ Get out of here! â€¦ â€¦ before it's too late.
181777	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>But no one was listening. They were greedily grabbing what they could.
188000	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong><strong>My uncle had fired his pistol</strong>in the air. The men looked up and saw the sky.
193734	Fear struck them and they ran up the beach, carrying what they couldâ€¦ They knew they had stayed too long. Morning was their enemy.
205100	â€¦ I was too weak to move, but my uncle picked me up and carried meâ€¦ In the<strong>panic</strong>, the carriage overturned. That meant there was only one small cart for everyone's escape.
221333	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Stand back! â€¦ I say stand back! â€¦Harry, make sure no one movesâ€¦ Shoot if necessaryâ€¦ I saidâ€¦
231666	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>There was blood everywhereâ€¦two men lay stillâ€¦ I<strong>fainted</strong>.
252666	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Mary, are you awake?
257888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>How long have I been lying here?
259888	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Two days.
262000	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Why didn't you wake me?
264000	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Maryâ€¦Iâ€¦
265555	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I've got to get up â€¦
266824	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Where are you going? Your uncle is downstairs.
268888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>He doesn't frighten meâ€¦ I must go and findâ€¦.
271777	<strong>Patience<br></strong>He's never been like this before. He's locked all the doors. He's afraid of someone â€¦ I don't know whoâ€¦
280090	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Don't go down, Mary, he's got a gunâ€¦!
286888	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>All the doors and windows are<strong>bolted</strong>. My uncle is sitting in the kitchenâ€¦
292111	<strong>Joss<br></strong>I heard noises outside. Did you hear anything?
297008	He'll comeâ€¦ He warned me but I didn't listenâ€¦We didn't plan it this time.
303982	<strong>Mary<br></strong>What do you mean? Who warned you? The officers?
309069	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Themâ€¦? They can't touch me. They need<strong>proof</strong>and all they have is a broken ship and two bodies.
317910	I wasn't there, was I â€“ I was at home with my wife and niece cosy by the fireâ€¦ No, it's himâ€¦ He'll murder us allâ€¦
329888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I don't understand. My uncle planned the wrecks, didn't heâ€¦ or did he?
338232	Was there someone else who gave the orders? Who is he so afraid of?
345150	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Why don't we get away quickly now?
347681	<strong>Joss<br></strong>You idiot! There are people everywhere who know what I've done.
352333	They'd like to see me hang â€¦ we'll stay till night time, when it's darkâ€¦ We'll leave then!
362859	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I go along with my uncle's plan, but in my mind I'm making other plans â€“ I'll escape somehow and find the vicarâ€¦. He's my only hope.
376888	Meet me in the next episode when things get even worse and I make a shocking discovery that will completely change my life at Jamaica Inn.
