1	(Introduction...)
10222	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I've hardly slept since my uncle's shocking <strong>confession</strong> - how he <strong>lures </strong>ships onto the rocks and drowns women and children.
21777	Today, however, I have escaped and am on my way with Jem to the horse market in Launceston.
36221	<strong>Jem <br></strong>It's Christmas Eve, Mary. Why so quiet? What's happened?
42100	<strong>Mary <br></strong>Nothing.
43295	<strong>Jem<br></strong>You look tired.
45222	<strong>Mary<br></strong>My uncle has been drinking...and talking.
49777	I know about the <strong>wrecks, </strong>Jem.
52249	<strong>Jem<br></strong>And you think <strong>I must be involved</strong>.?
54888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>There are gaps in the story and you fit into them.
58666	<strong>Jem <br></strong>So you think I watch men and women drown and then steal from their dead bodies?
63555	I may have taken some <strong>tobacco</strong> sometimes from the inn... but I've never killed a man.
69100	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>Can I believe him?
71072	<strong>Jem<br></strong>If you don't believe me, why have you come with me today?
74111	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I like your bright eyes.
79273	<strong>Mrs Bassat<br></strong>Look, James! That pony looks just like Beauty, except Beauty was grey. How much is she?
86046	<strong>Jem <br></strong>She's not for sale. I promised her to a friend.
89800	<strong>Mrs Bassat<br></strong>How much does your friend want?
92700	<strong>Jem<br></strong>30 <strong>guineas</strong>.
94293	<strong>Mrs Bassatt<br></strong>Well, I'm Mrs Bassat. I'd like to buy her for my children for Christmas. I'll give you 35.
100430	<strong>Jem<br></strong>OK. She's yours.
102444	<strong>Mrs Bassat<br></strong>Here. My man James will ride her home.
105555	<strong>Jem and Mary<br></strong>[laughing.]
108999	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Jem Merlyn, you should be ashamed!
116034	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Quick Mary, stand under here. I'll keep you warm.
124111	We'll get <strong>soaked</strong> if we go back tonight.
126666	Stay with me in Launceston tonight.
128888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>No, I've been <strong>foolish</strong> enough today.
132999	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Alright. I'll get the horse. Wait here.
138777	<strong>Mary <br></strong>He is rude, a thief and a liar. <strong>He might even be a murderer</strong>.
148111	And yet, if he wasn't so much like his brother, I could fall in love with him.
161411	<strong>Mary <br></strong>Where is he? He left over 30 minutes ago.
167111	I'll ask that horse seller over there. Excuse me, have you seen Jem Merlyn?
174228	<strong>Man<br></strong>The man with the black pony? I saw him with another man.
178000	They left in a <strong>carriage</strong>.
179405	<strong>Mary <br></strong>Oh no!
182555	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>Did they discover that the pony was stolen?
185666	Now I'm sorry I didn't agree to stay in Launceston with him.
189999	He went to get the horse to take me home...and now he's gone.
198090	<strong>Mary <br></strong>What shall I do? Perhaps someone will let me sleep on their floor.
203333	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Hello Mary. What are you doing here on Christmas Eve?
207333	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh, Vicar, it's you.
209666	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>Come, I'll take you home.
211999	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>Once again I tell him my story ...the market, Jem's disappearance.
218999	His glass eyes show no expression.
226000	<strong>Vicar<br></strong>You are young...don't cry over him.
229303	Am I right that it's quiet at Jamaica Inn.?
232888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>My uncle has been drinking.
236111	He talks. Vicar, do you know what <strong>wreckers</strong> are?
243200	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I tell him what my uncle told me - about using lights to bring ships onto the rocks .
250061	the dead women and children...the stolen <strong>cargo</strong>.
255777	<strong>Vicar</strong> <br>So your uncle talks when he is drunk, does he? Well there won't be any more wrecks.
262947	The government is putting officers on the coast to keep watch.
268000	I'll get off here. The driver will take you home. Goodnight, Mary.
281888	<strong>Mary <br></strong>What's happening.?
287666	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>A gun is pointing at me.
291033	I see a face I recognise - the eyes look crazy and mad.
297555	<strong>it can only be one person</strong>. <strong>Joss <br></strong>Get out! Ahh, so you've come back!
308777	What do you think you're doing at this time of night...on the road! Been with a man, I suppose.
314977	<strong>Mary <br></strong>Don't touch me! You're a murderer and a thief and I've been to Launceston today to <strong>inform</strong> on you.
322900	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Get back, you fools! She's lying.
326651	Get the horse Harry. The wind has changed. We'll use it.
332777	So, Mary, you think you can inform on me so I'll hang. You're coming with us!
339444	<strong>We might not get far</strong> but we won't stay here waiting to be caught! Away!
350222	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>Where we are going, I don't know.
353252	But I can see from the look in my uncle's eyes that something very bad is going to happen.
361620	Join me next time - and find out exactly how bad things get when I discover what Joss and his gang of bad men really get up to.
