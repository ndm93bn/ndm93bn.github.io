1	(Introduction...)
13444	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>I now know that my uncle is involved in smuggling.
20000	I also <strong>suspect</strong> that he has murdered a man.
24800	But if I tell, my aunt will suffer, so I can't do anything.
31901	Today, I am alone cleaning the kitchen. But the quiet does not last.
40041	<strong>Mary</strong><br>Who can that be?
44218	<strong>Mary narrator</strong><br>When I go in the bar, there's a man with a glass of beer. He looks familiar.
51700	<strong>Mary<br></strong>What do you think you're doing? You can't help yourself to drink!
56800	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Are you the barmaid?
58698	<strong>Fill up</strong> my glass.
60625	<strong>Mary<br></strong><strong>Fill it up</strong> yourself. I'll tell Mr Merlyn you are here.
65400	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Don't <strong>bother - </strong>he won't want to see me.
69888	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Well, I can't stand here waiting. <strong>Pay up</strong> and you can go.
76349	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Do you order Joss around like that?
79170	<strong>Mary<br></strong>He's my uncle. Patience was my mother's sister.
83325	Now, I have work to do...uncle!
89000	<strong>Joss<br></strong>Who the hell are you talking to? I told you to keep your mouth shut!
94903	Oh, it's you, Jem. What do you want?
99607	You can <strong>get on with</strong> your work, Mary.
102800	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>So that was Jem, my uncle's brother.
107986	He's got the same dark eyes and hair, but drink has not ruined his face - it's younger and more handsome.
123111	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Excuse me - I didn't expect to see a girl like you at Jamaica Inn.
128777	<strong>Mary<br></strong>My mother died, so I came here.
131999	I'm glad she isn't alive to see how my aunt lives now.
136333	I try to help her in the house. What do you do?
141070	<strong>Jem<br></strong>I steal horses.
142500	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Oh! Aren't you afraid of being caught?
145600	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Not really. Listen, I'm being serious now.
152100	Jamaica Inn is no place for you with its ugly business. I can help you go to Bodmin.
158400	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I don't need help. I can <strong>look after</strong> myself.
162222	<strong>Jem<br></strong>Well. I'm going now. But remember - I live in Trewartha if you ever need me.
169888	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>How can I trust him? He's a thief - and he's Joss's brother.
178800	The loneliness of my situation grips me again. The men have returned.
196000	From my window, I can see them lifting heavy objects onto the wagons.
202161	These men are <strong>desperate</strong> and dangerous.
206778	And Jem...? Did he come to warn his brother that they were coming?
216999	This morning, I'm doing the washing.
220700	My uncle is away, so I can almost feel the happiness I used to feel when I worked on the farm.
232000	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Mary!
234444	<strong>Mary<br></strong>What is it?
235333	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Mr Bassat is here - the <strong>magistrate, </strong>with another man.
238400	What are we going to do? He's never been before: he must know something.
243777	<strong>Patience<br></strong>What am I going to say?
246888	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>This is my chance to tell an officer about Joss - but look at my aunt.
254777	She is trembling and terrified.
258275	<strong>Mary<br></strong>Just say Joss is away.
260469	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Mary, you won't tell Mr Bassat about the wagons, will you?
264000	If anything happens to Joss, I'll kill myself.
269917	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong>You took your time. Where's the landlord?
274100	<strong>Mary<br></strong>He's not here.
275455	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong>When will he be back?
277000	<strong>Patience<br></strong>He went out after breakfast. I don't know when he's <strong>getting back.
281100	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong><strong>Damn!</strong>Listen to me - your husband is giving this whole area - my land - a bad <strong>reputation</strong>.
288555	<strong>Patience<br></strong>I don't know what you mean. We live a quiet life here - my niece will tell you!
294000	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong>I'm not a fool. We'll look around now we are here.
298777	<strong>Mary narrator<br></strong>Mr Bassat is having a good look around the inn. He knows there is something hidden here.
307297	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong>This place is a <strong>disgrace</strong>!
310150	Call yourself an inn! There isn't one clean room.
314333	<strong>Patience<br></strong>Mary, Mary - the room by the bar!
318200	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>We come to the locked room.
322111	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I'm afraid this room is locked.
324240	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong>Why?
325093	<strong>Mary<br></strong>I don't know.
326320	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong>Have you ever heard wheels and horses at night?
329845	<strong>Mary<br></strong>No, never.
331222	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong>Where is the key to the room?
333509	<strong>Mary<br></strong>My uncle has it.
335022	<strong>Mr Bassat<br></strong>Well, we'll have to <strong>break down</strong> the door, then.
338777	<strong>Mary narrating<br></strong>I'm afraid. I hate lying to save my uncle - and part of me will be glad if they find <strong>evidence </strong>of his crimes.
349222	I remember the rope. But the fear of what might lie behind the door is clear in my aunt's eyes.
358777	For her, it would be the end.
365000	In the next episode - I meet a man who I can talk to and tell him about the awful things I have seen - but can he be trusted?
