1	( Introduction... )
11397	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.
14245	<strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I'm Neil. Have you ever written any poetry, Alice?
17593	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No. Have you?
18599	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh yes. I've got a sheaf of poems from my youth.
21209	<strong>Alice<br></strong>A <strong>sheaf</strong> of something means a bundle of things, particularly paper. What about now? Are you still writing?
27524	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, my creative juices have dried up.
30031	<strong>Alice<br></strong>What a shame! I would have liked to hear some of your poems!
33254	<strong>Creative juices</strong> means a flow of ideas and the subject of today's show is creativity and <strong>writer's block</strong> - which means not being able to write because of a psychological problem.
44323	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So not like tennis elbow or golfer's knee, then.
47300	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No, Neil, because a psychological problem refers to the mind not the body.
52428	And whilst some people view writer's block as nonsense others believe it is a serious psychological condition that can get better with treatment.
60905	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I have a question for you, Alice.
62957	How does author of the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown, deal with writer's block?
67844	Does he. <br>a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots? <br>b) clean his 6-bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush? <br>Or c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner?
81399	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I think it's c) run a half-marathon listening to Wagner.
85359	Exercise and music might get your creative juices flowing again.
88821	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the right answer later on in the show.
92547	But first, Alice, can you tell us where the term writer's block comes from?
96950	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, the term was <strong>coined</strong> - or invented - in 1950 by a Viennese psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler.
103841	Let's listen to Zachary Leader, Professor of English Literature at Roehampton University talking about the psychoanalytic theory of writer's block.
112714	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Zachary Leader, Professor of English Literature at Roehampton University<br></strong>Before writers were blocked the other metaphors that were used were things like 'drying up' .
118445	or 'being frozen' or 'stuck in a rut' and so forth.
121972	And the difference between being blocked and drying up is that in the case of blockage the problem is externalised and objectified - it's not yourself that's the problem - it's something that's outside you like an obstacle or an impediment - something that you could really cut away, and as a consequence a cure like a growth or a foreign body.
143730	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So writer's block is a metaphor for an obstacle - something external rather than internal inside of you - that's preventing you from working.
152393	Doesn't that sound like an excuse for not doing anything, Alice?
155254	'It's not my fault - this impediment thing is getting in the way'.
158276	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
159665	Well, <strong>impediment</strong> is another word for obstacle.
162790	But how do you cut away a foreign body that isn't actually there?
166602	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I suppose psychoanalysts have an answer for that.
169425	But seriously, I think writers probably do have a hard time.
172833	You can sit down at your desk every morning at 9 o'clock to write but that doesn't mean you're going to think of things to say.
178883	Though we're never stuck for words, are we?
181412	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Not usually, Neil, no.
183148	But did you know that the Ancient Greeks had <strong>Muses</strong> - or goddesses of creativity - to help them?
190292	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So.
190777	BeyoncÃ© isn't a real muse?
192432	I've heard people say, you know, 'BeyoncÃ© is my muse; she's such a great singer, songwriter, dancer, role model!'
198589	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, these days, 'muse' can refer to anyone who inspires an artist, writer, or musician.
204311	But in Ancient Greece, there were nine Muses - and depending on what type of creative thing you did - philosophy, poetry, science and so on - you <strong>invoked</strong> - or called upon - that particular Muse to inspire you.
218575	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I call upon you, oh Alice, to enlighten us with more information about the Greek Muses.
223396	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Alright then.
224458	So let's listen to Angie Hobbs instead.
227691	She's Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield here in the UK - and here she is now, talking about what the Greek Muses symbolized.
237630	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Angie Hobbs, Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield<br></strong>We've seen that the Muses were connected to running water, to springs, to fountains, fluidity.
245404	So if you're musing, you are letting your mind wander, you're opening yourself up to new influences and new ideas, and not thinking in too structured a way.
255958	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Musing, letting your mind wander, thinking in a fluid, unstructured way - that all sounds very pleasant - maybe I should have another go at writing.
265063	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, according to research, some people are better at mind wandering and opening themselves up to new ideas than others.
271878	Their minds work differently - they have more dopamine in the thalamus region of the brain.
277365	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The <strong>thalamus</strong> controls consciousness, sleep and the senses and <strong>dopamine</strong> is the feel-good chemical in the brain.
284412	Is that right?
285141	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, and having more dopamine in the thalamus enables some people to see the world in a different way - and they express this creatively - through science, music, the arts.
295556	Now, before you start musing on how much dopamine you have in your brain, Neil, perhaps you can tell us the answer to today's quiz question?
303828	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I asked: How does author of the <em>Da Vinci Code</em>, Dan Brown, deal with writer's block?
309095	Does he. <br>a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots? <br>b) clean his 6-bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush? <br>Or c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner?
322374	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And I said c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner.
326458	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And you were wrong, Alice!
327998	The answer is a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots.
332672	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Really?
333135	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes.
333735	I expect all that increased blood flow to the brain is helpful in clearing writer's block.
337933	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
338387	Good plan.
339470	OK, here are the words we learned today.
341992	<br>creative juices<br>writer's block<br>coined<br>impediment<br>Muses<br>invoked<br>thalamus<br>dopamine
352785	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, Alice, shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely.
357310	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That's not your poem, Neil - It's Shakespeare's!
360647	Well, and that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
363523	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OK, I'm off to lie on the sofa and evoke my muse.
366875	Please join us again soon!
368132	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye!
