11774	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
15315	I'm Sophieâ€¦
16275	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.
17321	I was watching the news the other day, Sophie.
20009	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Learn anything interesting?
21630	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, actually.
22782	UK scientists have been authorised by the government to genetically modify human embryos for research.
29843	What they can't do though is implant modified embryos into women.
34643	They talked a lot about gene editing.
37075	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Can you explain to us what gene editing is?
39422	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Mmmâ€¦ I think this means there are these letters in a code - A-B-C somethingâ€¦ I can't remember exactlyâ€¦&nbsp;
47955	<strong>Sophie<br></strong><strong>Gene</strong> <strong>editing</strong> is the ability to <strong>manipulate</strong> - or control - DNA.
52989	And in case you didn't know, <strong>DNA</strong> is short for deoxyribonucleic acid - this is a substance in the cells of animals and plants that contains genetic information.
64082	And a <strong>gene</strong> is part of the DNA in&nbsp;the cell that controls the physical development and behaviour of a plant or animal and is passed on from its parents.
74258	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Phew!
75112	Thanks for the science lesson, Sophie.
77224	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>You're welcome.
78248	Now here's a question for you, Neil: Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered?
87954	Is itâ€¦<br>a) Robocop<br>b) Gattaca<br>or c) Blade Runner
94205	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Mmmâ€¦ I don't really understand the question but I'm going to say c) Blade Runner.
99858	What's dystopian?
101159	<strong>Sophie<br></strong><strong>Dystopian</strong> means an imaginary society where people are unhappy and afraid.
106237	Well, moving on, let's listen to BBC journalist Fergus Walsh talking about how gene editing works.
113852	<strong>INSERT<br>Fergus Walsh, BBC journalist<br></strong>Think of gene editing as a molecular sat nav.
117906	It scans the DNA searching for the error.
120956	Then it uses molecular scissors to snip through both strands, which switches off the faulty gene.
127228	Or it can repair the code by inserting a healthy copy of the gene.
132753	These techniques raise the prospect of treating - even curing - some genetic diseases - and it's not science fiction.
140199	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>So DNA is a set of instructions for how our bodies work written using a chemical code of four letters - A, T, C, G.
151334	But sometimes the code contains mistakes.
154001	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes.
154492	You find spelling mistakes by <strong>scanning</strong> - or searching - through the DNA.
159953	Then you <strong>snip</strong> - or cut out - the mistake or faulty gene from the code using molecular scissors.
165777	<strong>Faulty</strong> by the way, means something that isn't working properly - like the faulty brakes on my bike.
171025	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>That sounds really dangerous, Neil!
173051	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah, but I'm more worried about my faulty genes.
175846	I might have all sorts of genetic mistakes inside me.
179622	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>That wouldn't surprise me.
181542	But you've actually touched on a serious point.
183910	Latest research suggests all our bodies do contain genetic mistakes, some of which could cause disease.
190438	And as reporter Fergus Walsh said at the end of the clip, gene editing could be important for treating or even curing inherited genetic diseases.
200230	For patients with blood, immune, muscle or skin disorders it offers the possibility that their faulty cells could be removed, or changed in the lab, and then put back.
212176	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That sounds amazing.
213328	But is there a <strong>catch</strong>?
214971	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And that means a problem or drawback.
218064	Yes.
218747	Some people think that if editing the genes of a human embryo is allowed for curing disease, this will lead to editing the genes of embryos for reasons other than health.
229712	Let's listen to Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Centre for Genetics and Society in California talking about her concerns.
239525	<strong>INSERT<br>Marcy Darnovsky, Centre for Genetics and Society<br></strong>It's too risky, we don't need it, there are other ways to have healthy children, and it would open the door - possibly - to a world of genetic haves and have nots.
248890	We don't need more inequality, we don't need more discrimination in the world.
252837	<strong>Neil<br></strong>An <strong>embryo</strong> by the way is an animal or human starting to develop inside its mother.
259002	Marcy Darnovsky is against gene editing because it may be used to create <strong>designer babies</strong> - or babies whose genes have been selected to have certain desirable characteristics.
270181	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>She says it may <strong>open the door </strong>- or make it possible - a situation where embryos are genetically <strong>enhanced</strong> - or improved - to be more intelligent or physically stronger, for example.
283514	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And this will lead to more <strong>discrimination</strong> in the world - which means treating some people less fairly than othersâ€¦
289487	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>â€¦which is something that science fiction has been predicting for many years.
293732	It's that dystopian society we were discussing earlier, Neil!
297359	Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered?
305700	Is itâ€¦ a) Robocop b) Gattaca or c) Blade Runner?
311545	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said c) Blade Runner.
314084	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Sorry, Neil!
315193	It was b) Gattaca.
317796	This 1997 sci-fi film centres on the character Vincent Freeman, who wasn't genetically engineered, but is able to buy the genetic identity of another man in order to pursue his dream of travelling into space.
333156	The film's title uses the letters G, A, T and C, which are the four chemical codes making up DNA.
342606	<br>Now here are today's words: <br>gene editing<br>manipulate<br>DNA<br>gene<br>dystopian<br>scanning<br>snip<br>faulty<br>catch<br>embryo<br>designer babies<br>open the door<br>enhanced<br>discrimination
365112	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
367544	Please do join us again soon!
369251	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.
