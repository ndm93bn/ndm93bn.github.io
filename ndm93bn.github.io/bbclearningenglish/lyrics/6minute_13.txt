11670	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14294	I'm Sophie.
15212	[pause]
15638	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil?
17452	[sound of a smartphone] Neil!
19841	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, sorry!
21654	And I'm Neil.
23873	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil, please put down your phone.
26646	We're doing the show!
28182	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah, I know.
29292	Hang on a minute.
29889	I just need to tweet something and.
33772	Done!
34582	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the subject of today's show is social media and its impact on our daily lives.
40364	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hmm, well, I suppose it has had quite a big impact on mine.
44118	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>That's all too clear.
45825	Now, perhaps we can move on to today's quiz question?
49964	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Of course - I'm all ears.
52012	[sound of a smartphone] Oh, hang on, wait a second.
54145	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>There's a word to describe what you're doing, you know.
56790	Answer me this: Which word describes a situation where you're talking to someone and they suddenly look down at their phone or answer it?
64726	Is it.
65409	a) phobbing?
66796	<br>b) phibbing?
68332	<br>Or c) phubbing?
70486	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, you've got me there, Sophie!
72300	I have no idea!
73665	But I'll guess that it's c) phubbing!
76630	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not.
81089	Now, let's move on and talk about phone etiquette - <strong>etiquette</strong> means rules of polite behaviour in society or among people in a certain group.
91478	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well.
92161	interrupting conversations to check your phone has become a social norm, hasn't it, Sophie?
97345	<strong>Sophie<br></strong><strong>Social norms</strong> are the rules of behaviour considered acceptable in a group or society.
102913	I don't agree, Neil!
104684	Let's listen to Professor Sherry Turkle of Massachusetts Institute of Technology talking about social norms amongst students.
113281	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Sherry Turkle, American clinical psychologist and professor of the social studies of Science and Technology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br></strong>I interviewed hundreds of college students and what they talked about was what some of them called 'the rule of three'.
122881	And what the rule of three is which is that if you go to dinner with friends, you don't want to look down at your phone until you see that three people, let's say you're six at dinner, are looking up in the conversation.
138668	So there's a new etiquette where you don't look down unless three people are looking up kind of to keep a little conversation alive.
146710	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Professor Sherry Turkle.
150145	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Why don't you try out the rule of three once in a while?
153068	<strong>Neil<br></strong>There are only two of us here, Sophie - do the math!
156204	And I'm listening to you.
157761	mmm.
158764	let me just send a text message here on my phone .
161900	hang on.
162369	[pause]
162774	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil.
163841	NEIL!
165612	I'm not going to carry on with the show unless you pay attention!
169345	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Sorry, Sophie.
170049	Actually I was just doing that to wind you up.
172417	I wasn't really using my phone.
173932	Sorry.
174444	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And to <strong>wind someone up</strong> means to say or do something deliberately in order to annoy someone.
180268	Well, I do get wound up about people constantly checking their devices.
185366	Yesterday, I was in a cafĂ© and two girls came in.
189782	They sat down and started chatting away - but not to each other - they were tapping away at their devices.
197313	And there was no face-to-face conversation at all!
200790	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But you can have moments of connection using your devices, you know?
205185	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>If you have a<strong> connection </strong>with someone you engage emotionally.
209324	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly.
209878	I was on the train this morning and there were a couple sharing a tablet.
214316	They were looking at the screen, and talking about what they saw there.
217558	It was very intimate, and they were.
219926	well.
220246	very connected.
221334	Let's hear from Ian Sinclair, British poet and filmmaker, talking about a new generation of connected humans.
228566	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Iain Sinclair, British writer, poet, and filmmaker<br></strong>Physiologically we're changing, that almost the neck muscles are tipped over to look down.
234412	We're getting a new kind of human being.
236289	And I think - maybe I'm not getting it - but there is actually a different kind of intimacy emerging in which these instruments are very important.
243286	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>So Iain Sinclair says our <strong>physiology</strong> is changing - our bodies, our neck muscles are changing - to make it easier to look down all the time at our devices!
255020	But it isn't only muscles that might change as a result of our techie habits - it's the way we <strong>interact</strong> - or engage with each other too.
265046	Ian Sinclair talks about a different kind of intimacy emerging - what does he mean, Neil?
271574	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Our <strong>intimacy</strong> - or closeness - with other people is somehow connected up with our devices.
277676	They've become part of us.
279468	And I expect some day devices will literally be part of us - an implant in our necks or something.
285569	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>What a horrible thought!
287212	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Let's have the quiz question again Sophie to take your mind off it.
291286	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>OK.
292182	I asked: Which word describes a situation where you're talking to someone and they suddenly look down at their phone or answer it?
300694	Is it.
301292	a) phobbing?
302401	b) phibbing?
303766	Or c) phubbing?
305388	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said c) phubbing.
307521	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>You were right, Neil!
309356	Well done!
310636	It's a combination of' 'phone' and 'snubbing' - <strong>snub</strong> means to deliberately ignore someone you know.
317996	New words formed by putting together parts of existing words are known as blends or portmanteau words.
324908	And 'phubbing' is starting to appear in some online dictionaries.
329132	Now can we hear the words we learned today?
331713	[Silence, as Neil is concentrated on his phone]
333718	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil?
334166	OK!
335788	I'll say the words myself:<br>etiquette<br>wind someone up<br>have a connection with someone<br>physiology<br>interact<br>intimacy<br>snub
350081	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
353708	Don't forget to connect with us again soon!
356118	Come on Neil, connect with us!
358785	Come on!
360662	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, yeah, hang on, just got to.
363222	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Goodbye!
364972	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hang on.
365782	I'll be with you in a second.
366636	Yes.
368108	OK.
368748	Bye!
