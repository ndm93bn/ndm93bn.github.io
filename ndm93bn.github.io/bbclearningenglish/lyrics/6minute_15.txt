12047	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14799	I'm Sophie.
15695	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.
16697	Here's your coffee, Sophie.
19375	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Neil - remember that staff meeting we had yesterday?
23012	&nbsp; Why did you agree to having decaff coffee in the kitchen when I know you don't like it.
28409	and neither do I!
29316	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I know.
30063	It's just that the boss said that&nbsp;<strong>decaffeinated</strong> coffee - that's coffee with the caffeine removed - was a good idea, healthier, you know.
36847	And then everyone else agreed.
38863	And I.
39236	I don't know.
40452	I just felt uncomfortable disagreeing with everyone.
43087	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, it's interesting you should say that, Neil.
45401	Groupthink is the subject of today's show.
48111	<strong>Groupthink</strong> refers to the type of bad decisions we make when we are in a group.
52858	Decisions that are <strong>contrary to</strong> - or against - what we really think.
58319	A psychology experiment conducted in the 1950s showed that a lot of people do exactly that - they submit to the will of the group.
67631	<strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Neil<br></strong><span data-mce-mark="1">But before we hear more about this, now would be a good time for today's quiz question.
72772	And I get to ask you, Sophie!
74500	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>OK.
75322	What is it?
75887	<strong>Neil<br></strong>In which story by Hans Christian Andersen does a young boy dare to tell the truth when everyone else goes along with an obvious lie?
84335	Is it.
85135	<br>a) The Red Shoes<br>b) The Snow Queen<br>Or c) The Emperor's New Clothes
91236	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>OK.
92367	I think it's c) The Emperor's New Clothes.
95674	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show if that's right or not.
99258	Now, the psychologist Solomon Asch is well known for his conformity experiments from the 1950s.
105882	Can you tell us what 'conformity' means please, Sophie?
108378	<strong>Sophie<br></strong><strong>Conformity</strong> means behaviour that is the same as the way most other people behave.
113796	Asch's main finding was that group pressure can change a person's opinion, of even obvious facts.
121135	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And what did this Asch test involve?
123769	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>123 male participants were shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with three lines on it.
132335	The participants were then asked to say which line matched the line on the first card in length.
138895	The right answer was plain to see, but the participants felt pressurized into saying the wrong answer.
145690	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Why would they do that?
146991	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Because the majority of people taking part in the experiment had been told to give the wrong answer.
153583	Let's hear Professor Nick Chater's explanation.
156655	He works at the Warwick Business School here in the UK.
160495	<strong>INSERT<br>Nick Chater, Professor at Warwick Business School, UK<br></strong>By the time it comes to you a whole list of people have said something plainly wrong and you are either going to have to fold and say, 'well, I just agree with them' or you're going to rather uncomfortably say, 'well, I think it's <em>one</em> actually'.
175940	And most people, most of the time, tend to fold.
179194	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Professor Nick Chater.
180580	He uses the word <strong>fold</strong>, which means you give up.
184495	But, Sophie, if people are uncomfortable about supporting the wrong answer, or something they don't believe in, why do they do it?
192122	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Because even though we feel uncomfortable <strong>going along with</strong> - or agreeing with - something we don't believe, we're even more uncomfortable about disagreeing with the group.
203279	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I didn't realize that people were such sheep.
206287	I have a will of steel, Sophie.
208932	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Is that right?
210458	So, your <strong>will of steel</strong> - or strong determination - somehow melted away in the staff meeting yesterday, I suppose?
219759	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh well.
220740	of course.
222233	yes.
222564	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Let's move on and consider briefly how social media encourages groupthink.
227727	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, there's a real danger with something like, for example, the Twitter - the social networking service.
233711	Because when an opinion on Twitter starts to -trend-, it can take on a momentum of its own, and people adopt it simply because it's popular, not because they really believe it.
242810	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And <strong>momentum</strong> means a force that keeps something going once it has started.
247762	Let's hear from journalist and author, Jon Ronson.
251612	He has an interesting opinion about this.
254300	<strong>INSERT<br>Jon Ronson, journalist and author</strong> <br>One of the ironies here is that on social media we all like to see ourselves as nonconformists but when we all get together in a group what we're doing is using our individual nonconformity to create a more conformist world.
270652	So if somebody steps out of line, all us nonconformists, in this frightened conformist way, tear them apart.
279036	It's like we're defining the boundaries of normality by tearing apart the people on the outside.
287260	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Jon Ronson.
288700	Are you a <strong>nonconformist</strong> then, Neil - someone who thinks and behaves differently from other people?
295026	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I'm not the type that Jon Ronson is describing - one who joins up with other so-called nonconformists to bully people with different views.
302514	Now remember I asked you earlier: In which story by Hans Christian Andersen does a young boy dare to tell the truth when everyone else goes along with an obvious lie?
312988	Is it.
313671	a) The Red Shoes, b) The Snow Queen or c) The Emperor's New Clothes?
318951	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>I guessed c) The Emperor's New Clothes.
321842	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And you were right, Sophie!
324967	The Emperor's New Clothes is a story by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent.
336423	No one dares to say that he doesn't see any suit of clothes until a child cries out, -But he isn't wearing anything at all!
343964	-
343964	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>It's a great story - and a lesson to us all.
346983	Now can we hear the words we learned today please?
350012	<strong>Neil<br></strong>They are:<br>decaffeinated<br>groupthink<br>contrary to<br>conformity<br>fold<br>going along with<br>will of steel<br>momentum<br>nonconformist
363676	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
367026	Don't forget to join us again soon!
369223	<strong>Both<br></strong>Bye.
