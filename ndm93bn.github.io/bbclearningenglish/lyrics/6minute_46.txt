1	(Introduction...)
11666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six useful words or phrases. I'm Neil.
18700	<strong>Dan<br></strong>And I'm Dan. Today we're talking about one of the last mysteries of science.
23000	No, not if the universe will keep expanding forever, but this: how do cats and dogs find their way home over long distances?
30414	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We hear incredible stories of lost pets travelling tens and even hundreds of miles home - but scientists struggle to explain how they do it.
40111	<strong>Dan<br></strong>We'll hear the view of one scientist today. But before that - I have to ask an important question: Neil, are you <strong>a cat person</strong> or <strong>a dog person</strong>?
48500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, that's easy - I'm <strong>a cat person</strong>, for sure. Dogs are just a... well, they are hard work, aren't they?
55055	<strong>Dan<br></strong>If you say you are '<strong>a cat person</strong>' it means you prefer cats.' <strong>A coffee person</strong>' prefers coffee.
61555	A 'something' person likes or prefers that thing, often over another thing.
67222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Back to the topic, I'm <strong>a cat person</strong>. But can you answer this, Dan?
71700	Recently, a cat called Omar made headlines for being, possibly, the world's longest cat.
78100	How long is Omar? Is it.<br>a) 120 cm<br>b) 80 cm<br>Or c) 180 cm
88050	<strong>Dan<br></strong>I'm gonna say c) 180 cm.
91200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, from long cats to long-distance cats.
94000	Scientists were <strong>scratching their heads</strong> a couple of years ago when a lost cat called Holly travelled 200 miles to get home.
101700	How did it do it?
103007	<strong>Dan<br></strong>We say you '<strong>scratch your head</strong>' when you are confused about something.
107111	There are a few theories about how cats and dogs navigate - but we don't yet have the full answer.
113222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell, of course.
118333	Smells are like signposts - they let you know where you are.
122777	Visual <strong>landmarks</strong> also play a role, just as they do with humans.
127500	A <strong>landmark</strong> is something very easily recognised - a big building or mountain for example.
132777	<strong>Dan<br></strong>And what about this one: <strong>magnets</strong> are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal - for example, iron or steel.
141000	The Earth itself has a <strong>magnetic</strong> force.
144111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Birds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles - it tells them where north is.
149766	It's thought they have some iron in their beaks.
152500	<strong>Dan<br></strong>But some scientists think mammals also have this capability.
156666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So we have a few ideas - smell, <strong>landmarks</strong>, <strong>magnetic</strong> forces - but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles by itself back to its home?
167677	<strong>Dan<br></strong>Let's hear from cat and dog expert Dr John Bradshaw. How do cats build up the maps in their heads?
175500	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Dr John Bradshaw, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol<br></strong>What they do when they are in a new <strong>territory</strong> is explore it in a very <strong>systematic</strong> way. So they will go out in ever-increasing circles, they'll literally construct a mental map in their heads.
187888	And so a cat that's lost its territory probably does the same thing.
191662	They'll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles then eventually they'll either come across the <strong>territory</strong> or they'll come across a smell carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to go home.
204888	<strong>Dan<br></strong>Cats have a <strong>systematic</strong> approach - which means they use a <strong>system</strong>.
208605	Which is: first they walk around their area in a small circle, then a bigger one and then a bigger one - until they have a strong mental map of the place.
218500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes - a mental map is a map in your head - stored in your memory.
222600	And the area cats explore - their home area - is called their <strong>territory</strong>.
227142	Cats are <strong>territorial</strong> - which means their <strong>territory</strong> is very important to them.
232200	<strong>Dan<br></strong>Having a map is great, but what happens when a cat gets lost?
236700	Dr Bradshaw says that again, it moves around in bigger and bigger circles, until it finds a clue - which is a <strong>landmark</strong> or a smell - that tells it where it is.
247055	Well, that's the theory. Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don't have enough data - that's enough information about this.
255444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>When there is a scientific breakthrough - we'll bring it to you in 6 Minute English, I hope.
260333	For now, let's content ourselves with Omar, possibly, the world's longest cat. How long, Dan?
266333	<strong>Dan<br></strong>I said 180 cm.
268733	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Omar measures 120 cm - that's over two thirds of my height - and weighs a heavy 14 kg.
276933	<strong>Dan<br></strong>Well, one thing, Neil, if Omar ever got lost, he'd be found in no time.
281100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>He's a <strong>landmark</strong> in himself! Which reminds me - let's run through today's words again.
286222	If you're <strong>a cat person</strong>, you prefer cats. If you're <strong>an evening person</strong> - you prefer evenings.
291985	<strong>Dan<br></strong>I've always thought you were a kind person, Neil.
294333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Nice of you to say, but we only use the phrase with nouns, not adjectives!
299444	<strong>Dan<br></strong>Indeed. We don't want the listeners to be <strong>scratching their heads</strong>.
302500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, we can't confuse them!
304935	So let's explain the next one clearly - a <strong>landmark</strong> is something easily recognisable that lets you know where you are.
311800	The bridges in London are <strong>landmarks</strong>.
314052	<strong>Dan<br></strong>And can we say the parks are <strong>magnets</strong> in summer?
316800	A <strong>magnet </strong>is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel - but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things.
326222	Two more words: <strong>territory</strong> is a noun - the area of land that an animal considers to be its own.
333222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Animals who feel this strongly are described as <strong>territorial</strong>.
337077	Humans can be too - about land or subjects they feel they own or control.
341777	<strong>Dan<br></strong>And finally <strong>systematic</strong>: the adjective from system.
346000	We can talk about a <strong>systematic</strong> approach, a <strong>systematic</strong> solution, a <strong>systematic</strong> study.
350999	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And we have <strong>systematically</strong> worked our way through all of today's words!
355195	<strong>Dan<br></strong>Very good! Which means - it's time mention our own online <strong>territory</strong> - our website and social media pages.
362111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course bbclearningenglish.com!
367916	<strong>Dan<br></strong>Bye bye for now.
368888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Goodbye!
