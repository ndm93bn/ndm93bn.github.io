1	Introduction!
11673	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
13999	I'm Alice.
14799	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>And I'm Rob.
15876	Now, Alice - how old are you?
18905	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I'm 21, Rob - not a day older!
21519	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Come on, don't be coy about your age, Alice!
24143	- <strong>Coy</strong>, by the way, means not wanting to give away information about yourself.
27961	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I'm not being coy, Rob.
30340	I just.
31065	don't feel like telling everyone how old I am.
33892	Some people think it's rude to ask.
36676	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I don't mean to be rude of course but .
38841	well, you are being coy.
40452	I'm asking because today we're talking about age and whether you can be too old for some things.
46820	What do you think?
47962	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I'm too old to order off children's menus in restaurants - but I still do it.
52687	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Anything else?
53337	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, I couldn't <strong>pull an all-nighter</strong> anymore.
56271	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK.
56900	That's another way of saying stay up all night to finish something.
60602	That's what students do to get their work done.
62639	<strong>Alice<br></strong>I used to be able to do it, and now I couldn't.
65252	I struggle to stay up on New Year's Eve until midnight.
68378	But let's move on to today's quiz question.
71172	What percentage of people aged over 65 surveyed in the UK described themselves as old?
78138	Is it .
78895	<br>a) 6%?
81092	<br>b) 16%?
83236	<br>Or c) 60%?
85913	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, I think it's just a) 6%.
89039	People don't like to think of themselves as old.
91471	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show.
95492	First, let's explore the subject of aging more.
99311	Tell me, Rob, do you think you can be too old to take up a new hobby?
103460	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>I might be, I mean, depends on the hobby of course.
106586	I went for a run the other day, and it nearly killed me.
109540	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That just means you're unfit, Rob!
111876	Let's listen to Ernestine Shepherd who didn't think she was too old to take up an interesting new hobby.
118681	At the age of 71 she started bodybuilding and is currently listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest female bodybuilder in the world.
128623	<strong>INSERT<br> Ernestine Shepherd, bodybuilder<br></strong>If ever there were an anti-aging pill, I would call it exercise.
137455	I enjoy working out with the people who come to the church.
141124	Sometimes they say, "Oh, this hurts!"
144431	But I tell people, "Age is nothing but a number!""
149359	I am 75 years of age.
152580	This morning I awakened at 2.30.
157284	I have a group of four other people who run with me in the mornings.
162841	We run about ten miles.
165380	Every day.
166340	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Wow!
168666	That was Ernestine Shepherd.
170159	What an example to us all!
172143	<strong>Alice<br></strong><strong>Work out</strong>, by the way, means taking exercise to make yourself fit.
175802	I think it's true that if we did more exercise every day, we would all look and feel much better.
181988	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Ernestine is all for exercise but I'm afraid I'd take some anti-aging pill if one existed.
187940	<strong>Alice<br></strong>If something is advertised as being <strong>anti-aging</strong> it means it's designed to stop you looking older.
194351	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And you can find hundreds of products these days that claim to have anti-aging properties.
199418	Lots of lotions and potions for women in particular!
202751	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes.
203103	That's because women feel pressurized to look younger than their age.
206645	It's an example of ageism and it isn't fair.
209439	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Ageism</strong> means discrimination against people because of their age.
213610	And sometimes people can be discriminated against in the workplace for being 'too old'.
218762	Now, do you think you could be too old to take up a new job, Alice?
222239	<strong>Alice<br></strong>No, I don't get the concept of too old at all.
225237	My grandparents both still work and they have more enthusiasm and energy than I do.
230485	They hate being called <strong>senior citizens&nbsp;</strong>and<strong> old-age pensioners</strong> - or by the initials of these words, <strong>OAP</strong>.
238474	And they are right: who wants to be defined by their age?
241845	<strong>Rob<br></strong>You just said: "Don't get this concept".
244799	And to <strong>get something</strong> means to understand it.
247519	&nbsp;So I suppose you stay the same inside - it's just the outside that changes!
251957	We have to be young at heart at least.
253748	And age is no reason for some people to stop working if they are in good health.
258644	Let's listen to Trisha Cusden who started a new business at 65 supplying beauty products for older women.
266206	Her age actually inspired her choice of work.
269854	<strong>INSERT<br> Trisha Cusden, founder of Look Fabulous Forever<br></strong>I've had an idea, I've seen a problem and an opportunity, and I've done something about it - And created a business which I'm very happy to say is very successful.
280553	I mean [when] I started it, it was going to be a hobby, you know, something to keep me out of trouble, give me something to do.
286302	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Trisha Cusden there.
288222	She started a new hobby and it turned into a successful business enterprise.
293588	Now, before we finish, I'd just like to put the case for older men.
297918	My dad, my granddad, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Harrison Ford - they're all fantastic role models for us younger guys.
305812	<strong>Alice<br></strong>And a <strong>role model</strong> is somebody people admire and want to copy.
310526	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, that brings us round to the matter of today's quiz question, Alice.
314228	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, it does.
314996	I asked: What percentage of people aged over 65 surveyed in the UK described themselves as old in a survey?
323113	Is it .
323764	a) 6%, b) 16% or c) 60%?
330601	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yep.
331113	And I said a) 6%.
333262	Was I right?
333902	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, you were!
335438	You were right!
336483	Well done!
336996	More than 2,000 people aged between 65 and 93 were surveyed by UK market research firm YouGov.
344643	Now here are the words we learned today, Rob.
348185	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They are:<br>coy<br>pull an all-nighter<br>work out<br>anti-aging<br>ageism<br>senior citizen<br>old-age pensioner (or OAP)<br>get something<br>role model
363534	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
366339	Don't forget to join us again soon!
368260	<strong>Both<br> </strong>Bye.
