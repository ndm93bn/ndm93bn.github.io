12542	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neil.
16444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'm Catherine. And today we're talking about hyphenation.
21444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hyphens are those little signs â€“ like dashes â€“ that we use in writing to join two words together.
27930	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, like in <strong>old-fashioned. There's always a hyphen between<strong> old </strong>and <strong>fashioned.
33555	Let's start with a clip from Brian. He's a news reporter, and he's reporting from a high school about an election.
41600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Think about this question while you're listening: How does Brian describe the young people at the school? Here's Brian.
49800	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Brian<br></strong>I asked some <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> students at <strong>this secondary school</strong> how they're voting in this year's election.
57800	They're all <strong>hard-working </strong>young people.
60500	<strong>Twenty-two</strong> of them are undecided and are likely to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.
66700	But a sizable group say today's politicians are not <strong>well respected</strong> and their attitudes are <strong>out of date</strong>.
76177	Back to the studio.
77775	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So we asked you: How does Brian describe the young people at the school?
83444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: He says they are <strong>hard-working.
87111	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That means they work hard.
89300	Now there are lots of compound adjectives like <strong>hard-working</strong> that we make with an adjective or adverb like <strong>hard</strong> plus a present participle like <strong>working</strong>.
100607	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we always write them with a hyphen.
104100	So <strong>hard hyphen working</strong> (hard-working).
107000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And we can make compound adjectives in other ways too.
110700	Listen to this clip for three more examples.
114800	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Brian<br></strong>I asked some <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> students at this<strong> secondary school</strong> how they're voting in this year's election.
122666	<strong>Twenty-two</strong> of them are undecided and are likely to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.
128800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>First we had <strong>eighteen-year-old</strong> <strong>students</strong>.
132700	<strong>Eighteen-year-old</strong> is an adjective made from three words joined together with hyphens.
139300	When we write age before a noun, we use hyphens.
143660	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Eighteen hyphen year hyphen old</strong> (eighteen-year-old)<strong>.
148400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. And it's the same with numbers; for example, we write the phrase <strong>a two-door car</strong> like this:
156300	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>A two hyphen door car</strong> (a two-door car)<strong>.
160616	But that's only for numbers <strong>before</strong> the noun.
164513	If you write: <strong>the students are eighteen years old</strong>, you don't need hyphens.
169831	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now, the second compound in that clip was <strong>twenty-two</strong>.
174088	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the rule is: always use hyphens in numbers from <strong>twenty-one</strong> to <strong>ninety-nine</strong>.
179922	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Twenty hyphen one </strong>(twenty-one).
182333	Two hundred and <strong>ninety hyphen nine </strong>(two hundred and ninety-nine).
184750	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Good. Now the last compound adjective we had there was <strong>last-minute.
190807	The students were going to make a <strong>last-minute</strong> decision.
194500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's the adjective <strong>last</strong> plus the noun <strong>minute</strong>, joined with a hyphen.
199248	Now for another clip. Listen out for some more compound adjectives.
203666	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Brian<br></strong>A sizable group say today's politicians are not <strong>well respected</strong> and their attitudes are <strong>out of date.
212999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Well respected.</strong>That's an adverb, <strong>well</strong>, and the past participle of a verb, <strong>respected</strong>.
220393	And together, they make an adjective, and the two parts of the adjective need a hyphen when we write them before a noun.
227555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So it's a<strong> well-respected politician</strong>, with a hyphen: <strong>well hyphen respected politician </strong>(well-respected politician).
236100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. But in a phrase like <strong>the politicians were well respected </strong>we don't use a hyphen, because the adjective comes after the noun, not before.
247352	And that rule is the same for three-word compound adjectives like <strong>out-of-date</strong>.
253100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, the phrase<strong> out-of-date attitudes</strong> has hyphens because the adjective is before the noun, but the phrase <strong>their attitudes are out of date</strong> doesn't have hyphens.
265505	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. And one last rule is that we never use hyphens in compound adjectives that have an adverb which ends in <strong>-l-y</strong>.
276100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, we don't. So in phrases like<strong> a carefully written letter</strong> we don't use hyphens.
282419	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now let's talk about <strong>compound</strong> <strong>nouns</strong>.
285612	In our clip, Brian was reporting from a secondary school.
289500	The phrase <strong>s</strong><strong>econdary school</strong> is a compound noun - and there's no hyphen in it.
295695	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, there isn't. Most compound nouns are written as two separate words.

303565	<strong>IDENT</strong><br>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.
308900	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's time for a quiz! Number one: What's the compound adjective in this sentence and does it need a hyphen?
319004	<strong>We were late because of the slow-moving traffic.
324000	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Slow-moving</strong> is the compound adjective, and it needs a hyphen.
329100	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Very good! And number two.
331155	Is there a hyphen in <strong>a forty-mile run</strong>?
335900	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, there is. <strong>Forty hyphen mile run</strong> (forty-mile run)<strong>.
340300	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number three: <strong>The teacher was very well liked</strong>.
344326	Is there a hyphen in <strong>well liked</strong>?
347700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We don't need a hyphen there.
349944	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done if you got those right. And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip.
354300	When you are reading, make a note of compound adjectives and nouns with - and without - hyphens.
