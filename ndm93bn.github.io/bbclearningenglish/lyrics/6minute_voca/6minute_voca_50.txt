18301	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>A very smart Neil - and I'm Catherine. Why are you wearing a suit, Neil?
22028	You're looking very smart for work.
23708	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes you're right, I am wearing a suit because I'm going to a wedding<strong> at one o'clock</strong>!
30372	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very good! I love weddings.
32311	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I love weddings too. I'm going to another one <strong>on Saturday</strong>!
36166	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Fantastic Neil. And<strong> at </strong>and <strong>on</strong> are two of the words weâ€™re discussing in today's programme.
42100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, because we're talking about time expressions with <strong>in, on</strong> and <strong>at</strong>.
48555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We'll explain why we say <strong>at</strong> <strong>one o'clock </strong>but <strong>on Saturday.
54100	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, and we'll give you lots of examples.
57258	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Let's start by listening to Mike and Rob. They are trying to find a time to meet up.
62400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Think about this question while you listen: what time can Rob meet Mike?
68600	<strong>INSERT</strong> <br><strong>Mike<br></strong>How about lunch <strong>on Monday, Rob?
71075	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well. I've got a meeting <strong>at 11.30.
74500	<strong>Mike</strong><br>Ok, are you free <strong>on Tuesday</strong>?
77800	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Hmm... the engineer's coming <strong>at lunchtime</strong>.
80300	The washing machine's flooded again! It happened <strong>at Easter</strong>, too.
83726	<strong>Mike</strong><br>Well, what are you doing <strong>in the afternoon?
87200	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Sorry - I'm playing football.
89300	<strong>Mike</strong><br>Ok - perhaps we could meet in the pub<strong> on Saturday evening?
94743	<strong>Rob</strong><br>We've got guests<strong> at the weekend.
97444	How about this afternoon <strong>at two thirty</strong>?
103300	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So, we asked you: What time can Rob meet Mike?
107222	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is: <strong>at two thirty.
110200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>When we say a particular time on the clock, we use <strong>at</strong>.
115203	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, we say <strong>at two thirty, at three o'clock.
119600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We also use <strong>at</strong> in other time expressions. Listen out for them in this clip.
124836	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1 </strong> <br><strong>Mike</strong><br>How about lunch <strong>on Monday, Rob?
127000	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Wellâ€¦ I've got a meeting <strong>at 11.30.
130400	<strong>Mike</strong><br>Ok, are you free <strong>on Tuesday</strong>?
133800	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Hmmâ€¦ The engineer's coming <strong>at lunchtime</strong>.
136100	The washing machine's flooded again! It happened <strong>at Easter</strong>, too.
140600	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So Rob had a meeting <strong>at 11.30.
144152	It's<strong> at </strong>because itâ€™s a time<strong>.
147334	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. We also heard <strong>at lunchtime</strong>.
151100	We use <strong>at</strong> with particular points during the day, like mealtimes, so it's <strong>at breakfast, at lunch, at dinner</strong>.
160111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and also we say <strong>at noon</strong>,<strong> at midnight</strong>.
164100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now Rob said his washing machine flooded <strong>at Easter</strong>.
168222	We use <strong>at</strong> to talk about a special day or group of days.
172900	So, itâ€™s<strong> at Easter, at New Year.
175800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>At Christmas. So that's <strong>at</strong>. Letâ€™s look at <strong>on</strong>.
180800	We use <strong>on</strong> with days of the week. So: <strong>on Monday,</strong> <strong>on Tuesday</strong>.
187000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We also use <strong>on</strong> with specific dates: <strong>on the third of May, on June the 20th</strong>.
193500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and we use <strong>on</strong> with specific days: <strong>on Christmas Day, on Easter Sunday, on my birthday</strong>!
202144	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. But remember it's<strong> at Easter, at Christmas </strong>when we are referring to the general time period.
209600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's listen to another clip with more time expressions.
213900	Listen out for the time expression with <strong>in</strong>.
218016	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2</strong> <br><strong>Mike</strong><br>What are you doing <strong>in the afternoon?

228260	<strong>Rob</strong><br>We've got guests<strong> at the weekend.
230900	How about this afternoon<strong> at two thirty?
234000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So we had <strong>in the afternoon</strong>.
237390	We use <strong>in</strong> with parts of the day, so it's <strong>in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening.
244110	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But did you notice that it's<strong> on Saturday evening.
248194	If we use a day of the week plus <strong>morning, afternoon</strong> or <strong>evening, </strong>we use <strong>on</strong>.
255000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We also use <strong>in</strong> with seasons, so it's<strong> in spring, in the winter.
260600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We use <strong>in</strong> with months and years, so it's <strong>in June, in 1996.
267200	<strong>Neil <br></strong>Notice also that Rob said <strong>at the weekend</strong>.
270869	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Rob speaks British English so he used <strong>at the weekend</strong>.
275320	Some other speakers will say <strong>on the weekend</strong>. It's perfectly fine.
