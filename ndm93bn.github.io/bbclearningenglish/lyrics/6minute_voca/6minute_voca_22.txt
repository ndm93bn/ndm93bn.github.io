12836	<strong>Catherine</strong>  <br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherineâ€¦
16670	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I'm Neil.
19406	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Neil, like your hat!
21300	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thank you very much. It's cold outside, so I thought it would be <strong>sensible </strong>to wear a woolly hat.
28969	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes.
29668	<strong>Neil<br></strong>My ears are very <strong>sensitive</strong> to the cold.
32400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I've noticed your ears looking a little bit red of a morning, occasionally, Neil.
37300	And the words <strong>sensible</strong> and <strong>sensitive </strong>are good examples of today's topic.
43400	The two words look and sound similar, but they have very different meanings.
48800	And in this programme we're going to talk about more pairs of words that people sometimes get mixed up.
55643	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now let's now hear about Mike. He was in a shop yesterday when he made a mistake.
61954	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Think about this question while you listen: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?
67902	<strong>INSERT<br></strong>Mike felt <strong>bored</strong>.
70927	He was watching a <strong>boring</strong> film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>.
75826	'I know â€“ I'll make a cake', he thought.
80963	'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'.
83708	The <strong>recipe</strong> looked easy â€“ just a few <strong>ingredients</strong>.
88939	But when Mike checked the <strong>contents</strong> of his cupboard, there wasn't any sugar.
95400	He went to the shop and bought some. The cake looked great. But it tasted horrible.
105616	Mike checked the <strong>receipt</strong>. He'd bought salt by mistake!
112546	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we asked you: What mistake did Mike make in the shop?
117400	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And the answer is: He bought salt instead of sugar.
121500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, the <strong>receipt</strong> said 'salt' but the <strong>recipe, </strong>of course, said 'sugar'.
126000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The nouns <strong>receipt </strong>and <strong>recipe </strong>look very similar, but they have different meanings.
132207	A <strong>receipt</strong>, r â€“ e â€“ c â€“ e â€“ i â€“ p â€“ t, is a document that shows you have paid money for something.
144000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and a <strong>recipe</strong>, r â€“ e â€“ c â€“ i â€“ p â€“ e, is a set of cooking instructions.
152200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Listen to a clip from Mike's story. Can you spot two more confusing words?
157800	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>He was watching a boring film about plants in the <strong>desert</strong>.
163200	'I know â€“ I'll make a cake', he thought.
168200	'We'll have it for <strong>dessert</strong>'.
170600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So that's<strong> desert</strong> and <strong>dessert</strong>.
174800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yep. Now a <strong>desert </strong>is an area of land where very little can grow and there's very little water.
182200	<strong>Desert, </strong>d â€“ e â€“ s â€“ e â€“ r â€“ t, has one 's', but <strong>dessert</strong>, d â€“ e â€“ s â€“ s â€“ e â€“ r â€“ t, has two 's'.
198508	A <strong>dessert</strong> is a sweet food course that we eat at the end of a meal.
203900	Right. Moving on. Neil, what do you do when you are <strong>bored</strong>?
208800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well I find making cakes <strong>boring</strong>.
211949	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Really?
212500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah. When I'm <strong>bored</strong>, I knit.
214800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You knit?
215563	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yeah.
216346	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Of course - the hat! The woolly hat!
218200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, I knitted this woolly hat.
219700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It's fantastic!
220600	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Bored</strong> and <strong>boring</strong> â€“ both adjectives, but with very different meanings.
225720	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Bored</strong>, b â€“ o â€“ r â€“ e â€“ d, describes how someone is feeling, when they are not interested in something.
235200	<strong>Boring</strong>, b â€“ o â€“ r â€“ i â€“ n â€“ g, describes a thing that is not very interesting.
244000	Right. Let's have another clip.
246100	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>The recipe looked easy â€“ just a few <strong>ingredients</strong>.
250700	But when Mike checked the <strong>contents</strong> of his cupboard, there wasn't any sugar.
257200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The words <strong>ingredients </strong>and <strong>contents</strong> both mean things that are a part of something else.
262900	Individual <strong>ingredients</strong> are things that we put together to make something, usually food â€“ a cake for example.
269800	<strong>Contents </strong>are all the separate items inside something like a box or a cupboard.
