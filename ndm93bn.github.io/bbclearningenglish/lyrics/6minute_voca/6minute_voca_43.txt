7390	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hi! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. My name is Catherine, and I'm here with Rob.
13900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello everyone. Today we're going to be talking about different words for jobs, and especially how those words change depending on whether a man or a woman is doing the job.
26555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and listen carefully because we're going to give you a quick quiz.
29900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And then you'll get a tip to help with your vocabulary learning.
33622	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, so let's get started! First we're going to listen to listen to Joe, talking about how he met his girlfriend, Judith.
41111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>While you listen, here's a question for you to think about: what is Judith's job now? Listen carefully!
51444	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Joe<br></strong>Well, I used to be an <strong>actor</strong>, and I met Judith at work.
55800	We were doing a play about a <strong>policeman</strong>, who falls in love with a <strong>waitress</strong>.
60500	I played the <strong>policeman</strong>, and Judith played the <strong>waitress</strong> â€“ and sure enough, we fell in love!
66444	Later, I quit acting, and now I'm a <strong>businessman</strong>.
70100	But Judith has a successful acting career â€“ right now, she's on a film shoot: she's playing a <strong>firefighter</strong>!
81048	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, the question was: what is Judith's job now?
84555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And the answer is, Judith is an <strong>actress</strong>. Right now, she's making a film.
89826	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The first job that Joe mentioned was <strong>actor</strong>.
92880	Now, this is one of those jobs where the word changes, depending on whether a man or a woman is doing the job.
99826	So, we say that a man is an <strong>actor</strong>, but a woman is an <strong>actress</strong>.
104800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's right. When Joe met Judith, she was playing a <strong>waitress</strong>.
109100	Again, we can say a man is a <strong>waiter</strong>, and a woman is a <strong>waitress</strong>.
113777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, so we've got<strong> actor, actress; waiter, waitress.</strong> You can hear the pattern, can't you?
121666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I can, yes. Judith was playing a <strong>waitress</strong> in the play, but can you remember what Joe was playing? Listen again:
129888	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br></strong>We were doing a play about a <strong>policeman</strong>, who falls in love with a <strong>waitress</strong>.
135666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, so Joe was playing a policeman, and we say that a man is a <strong>policeman</strong>, and a woman is a <strong>policewoman</strong>.
142987	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Now, Joe is a businessman because he's a man. But for a woman, we can say <strong>businesswoman</strong>.
149888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, so<strong> policeman, policewoman; businessman, businesswoman.</strong> Easy, isn't it?
157085	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well maybe it's not quite so easy, because we know that Judith is making a film right now, but do you remember what sort of character she is playing? Listen again and check:
168999	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>But Judith has a successful acting career â€“ right now, she's on a film shoot: she's playing a <strong>firefighter</strong>!
176999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, so Judith is playing a <strong>firefighter</strong>.
181666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But wait, hold on a minute Catherine, there's something strange about that word, <strong>firefighter</strong>.
188000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, Indeed. A <strong>waiter</strong> is a man, and a <strong>policewoman</strong> is a woman.
192396	What about a <strong>firefighter</strong>? Man or woman? What is it?
195333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, in fact, the word <strong>firefighter </strong>is the same for a man or a woman.
200000	More and more, in modern English, people prefer to use words for jobs which are the same for both sexes.
206222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>They do. For example, some people prefer not to use the word<strong> actress</strong>.
211222	They just like to use the word <strong>actor</strong> for a man or a woman.
214488	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And instead of <strong>policeman</strong> or <strong>policewoman</strong>, we can say <strong>police officer</strong>.
219222	That's good for a man or a woman, too.
221304	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And that's why we say <strong>firefighter</strong>.
223389	We don't say fireman, firewoman, we just use<strong> firefighter</strong> these days for everyone.
228403	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
234805	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And we're talking about job words that change depending on whether a man or a woman is doing the jobâ€¦
240765	<strong>Rob<br></strong>â€¦and job words that are the same for both men and women.
244111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Those are my preferred options, what about you Rob?
246555	<strong>Rob<br></strong>I think it's easier and less complicated, yes, to use those sort of generic words.
251555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, like <strong>presenter</strong>.
253100	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Like <strong>presenter</strong>. Not 'presenteress' or anything like that.
255000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Indeed. And some job titles that used to be different for men and women are now being replaced by a single job title for both sexes.
264877	For example on planes, in the past, we used to have <strong>stewards</strong> and <strong>stewardesses</strong> looking after the passengers. Now we just have, Robâ€¦
274111	<strong>Rob<br> We just have Flight attendants</strong>. And instead of a <strong>chairman</strong> or a <strong>chairwoman</strong> in charge of a formal meeting, these days we often hear the word <strong>chairperson.
284000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or just <strong>chair</strong>.
285822	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK.
286595	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, so now it's time to see how much you can remember.
292222	And we've got three quiz questions for you.
294888	Number one: if the word for a man is<strong> businessman</strong>,what's the word for a woman?
300999	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And the answer is <strong>businesswoman</strong>.
305147	Second, if the word for a woman is <strong>waitress</strong>, what's the word for a man?
310888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Waiter</strong>! Right, and just one more question: if a man can be a <strong>policeman</strong>, and a woman can be a <strong>policewoman,</strong> what's the word that's equally good for a man or a woman?
323888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>It's <strong>police officer</strong>! Did you get all those right? Well done if you did!
330359	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And before we go, here's a top tip to help you learn your vocabulary more effectively.
336777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>When you're out and about, walking down the street, or sitting on the bus, notice the people you see, and say the words for them to yourself in English - like<strong> waitress</strong> or <strong>police officer</strong>.
347798	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or <strong>presenter</strong>.
348855	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Indeed.
