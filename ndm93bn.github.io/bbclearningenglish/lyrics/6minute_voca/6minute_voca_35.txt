12666	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Callum.
16333	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And me Finn. Today weâ€™re talking about large numbers.
20955	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Particularly how we say and describe them in English.
25700	Hereâ€™s Anita, whoâ€™s giving a talk to a tour group visiting Russia.
30666	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Listen out for the answer to this question: How many metres high is Mount Elbrus?
37111	<strong>INSERT <br>Anita<br> </strong>Russia is a land of superlatives! At over <strong>6,500,000</strong> square miles, it's the largest country in the world.
47222	And the total area of cultivated land has been estimated as <strong>a six-figure number</strong>: perhaps <strong>500,000</strong> square miles.
56550	Its mountain ranges contain Mount Elbrus, which at <strong>5,642</strong> metres is the highest point in both Russia and Europe.
67420	Of its rivers, which are <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>, the River Volga, the longest river in Europe, is the most well known.
77333	And what about the people? Well, hereâ€™s an interesting fact: the number of languages spoken in Russia is&nbsp;<strong>in triple figures</strong> â€“ yes, over 100!
96555	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>So that was Anita. And we asked: How many metres high is Mount Elbrus?
101955	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>And the answer is <strong>five thousand, six hundred and forty-two metres</strong> high.
107900	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Which is a good example of our topic today.
110777	When saying a large number, we always begin with the biggest number first. So thousands, then hundreds, then tens.
119666	Tens means numbers with two digits in them, like <strong>forty-two</strong>. Listen again.
125507	<strong>Finn<br> </strong><strong>Five thousand, six hundred and forty-two</strong>.
129432	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>And the other point is, that the number labels are always singular.
134666	So <strong>five thousand</strong> and not five thousands.
139150	<strong>Finn<br> Six hundred</strong> and not six hundreds.
142970	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Exactly. Now, notice that we donâ€™t connect thousands and hundreds with the word <strong>and</strong>.
149300	Itâ€™s <strong>five thousand, six hundred</strong>.
152150	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Not five thousand and six hundred.
155000	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>But we do connect hundreds and tens with the word <strong>and.</strong> So <strong>six hundred and forty-two.</strong> And I think itâ€™s time for our first clip.
164222	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br> </strong>Russia is a land of superlatives! At over <strong>6,500,000</strong> square miles, it's the largest country in the world.
173855	And the total area of cultivated land has been estimated as a <strong>six-figure number</strong>: perhaps 500,000 square miles.
180800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we heard <strong>six million, five hundred thousand</strong>.
184866	Notice that we donâ€™t connect millions to thousands with the word <strong>and </strong>either, or in this case, millions to hundreds of thousands.
195110	We say it like this: <strong>six million, five hundred thousand</strong>.<br> <strong>Callum<br> </strong>Now, how did Anita describe the figure <strong>500,000</strong>?
198266	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>She described it as <strong>a six-figure number</strong>. Because it contains six digits.
204888	We could also say itâ€™s <strong>a six-digit number</strong>.
208100	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Yes, we sometimes describe a number in this way to emphasise how big it is.
212555	And it doesnâ€™t have to be six. It could be a <strong>five-figure</strong> or a <strong>four-figure</strong> <strong>number</strong>.
217200	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Now, on to clip 2.
218700	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br> </strong>Of its rivers, which are <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>, the River Volga, the longest river in Europe, is the most well known.
228500	And what about the people? Well, hereâ€™s an interesting fact: the number of languages spoken in Russia is&nbsp;<strong>in triple figures</strong> â€“ yes, over 100!
241666	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>So how did Anita describe the number of rivers in Russia?
246000	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>She said theyâ€™re <strong>in the hundreds of thousands</strong>.
249711	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>When we want to describe approximately what a number is, we can say itâ€™s <strong>in the tens, the hundreds, the thousands</strong> and so on.
258600	<strong>Hundreds of thousands</strong> means at least 100,000 and probably a lot more.
264300	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So you could even say that a number is <strong>in the tens of millions</strong>.
269150	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>There was also an interesting fact there about the number of languages spoken in Russia.
273950	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Anita said theyâ€™re <strong>in triple figures</strong>.
276823	That means that the number contains three figures â€“ so at least 100.
283155	Itâ€™s the same as saying that the number is <strong>in the hundreds</strong>.

293111	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>And itâ€™s quiz time! Number one: How do we say this number?
299700	<strong>8-9-2-1</strong>. Thatâ€™s <strong>8-9-2-1</strong>.
309207	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>Itâ€™s eight thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one.
315000	<strong>Callum</strong><br> Well done! Number two: What kind of number is <strong>300,000</strong>? Is it:&nbsp;a) a five-figure number b) a six-figure number c) a six-figures number?
329500	<strong>Finn</strong><br> Itâ€™s b) a six-figure number.
334300	<strong>Callum.<br></strong>Correct! Number three: Listen to this number: <strong>19,242</strong>.
341900	Is it a) in the thousands b) in the tens of thousands c) in the hundreds of thousands?
351844	<strong> Finn<br> </strong>This one is b) In the tens of thousands.
356400	<strong>Callum<br> </strong>Excellent! How did you do? Very well done if you got them all right.
