12666	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Neilâ€¦
17100	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And I'm Catherine. And it's very good to see you back at work today, Neil.
23617	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thanks, it's nice to be back. I hate being off sick.
27444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We've missed you. we have missed you. And there has been a lot of sickness in the office this week, and <strong>sickness</strong> is one of the words that we're looking at in today's show.
37070	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. Today we're talking about the suffixes <strong>-ness</strong> and <strong>-ity</strong>.
42000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>In the world of vocabulary, suffixes are two or three letters at the end of a word. They can tell you what type of word it is.
50800	The suffix <strong>-ness</strong>, spelt<strong> n-e-s-s</strong>, at the end of the word <strong>sickness</strong> tells you that the word is a noun, which comes from the adjective <strong>sick</strong>.
62571	<strong>Neil<br></strong>In this programme we'll give you lots more examples of words with the suffix <strong>-ness</strong> and also we'll find about the suffix <strong>-ity</strong>, spelt <strong>i-t-y</strong>.
72050	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. And we'll have a quiz.
73955	<strong> Neil <br></strong>...and we'll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
80026	So let's get started by hearing from Arjuna. And he's talking about how he feels about being a nurse.
88828	<strong>Neil<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: How does Arjuna often feel at the end of the day?
96888	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Arjuna<br></strong>I have a lot of <strong>responsibility</strong>.
100600	Sometimes it's upsetting, like telling someone there's a <strong>possibility</strong> they have a serious <strong>illness</strong>.
107061	The hours are long and <strong>tiredness</strong> can be a problem at the end of the day.
111861	But the rewards are there too, like the <strong>happiness</strong> of a mother holding her newborn baby.
118739	And of course there are the cards and gifts - I'm always touched by the <strong>kindness</strong> and <strong>generosity</strong> of the patients.
127600	<strong>Neil</strong><br>So we asked you: How does Arjuna feel at the end of the day?
132077	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And the answer is: he feels tired. In fact, he says that '<strong>tiredness</strong> can be a problem'.
138700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>The word <strong>tiredness</strong> comes from the adjective <strong>tired</strong>.
143000	Nouns with the suffix <strong>â€“ness</strong>, spelt<strong>n-e-s-s</strong>, like <strong>tiredness</strong>, describe the feeling or state of the original adjective.
153333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So <strong>tired â€“ ness </strong>is the feeling of being tired.
158055	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. <strong> Ill â€“ ness</strong> is the state of being ill.
163301	<strong>Sick â€“ ness</strong>, which we heard at the start of the programme, is the state of being <strong>sick</strong>.
169832	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Poor you, Neil. Let's hear some more examples of this suffix.
174777	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Arjuna<br></strong>But the rewards are there too, like the <strong>happiness</strong> of a mother holding her newborn baby.
181932	And of course there are the cards and gifts - I'm always touched by the <strong>kindness</strong> and <strong>generosity</strong> of the patients.
190333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we had <strong>happiness</strong>.
193066	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...from the adjective <strong>happy</strong>.
194916	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>kindness</strong>.
196333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>...from the adjective <strong>kind</strong>.
198064	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>In <strong>kindness</strong>, the suffix <strong>-ness</strong> makes a noun that is a quality.
203300	The suffix <strong>-ity</strong>, spelt<strong> i-t-y</strong>, which we heard in the word <strong>generosity </strong>there, also changes an adjective into a quality.
213512	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Generosity</strong> comes from the adjective generous. It means: the willingness to give things.
219508	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And Arjuna thinks hispatients are generous because they give the nurses cards and gifts.
225555	Let's hear some more words with the suffix <strong>-ity</strong>.
228987	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Arjuna<br></strong>I have a lot of <strong>responsibility</strong>.
232868	Sometimes it's upsetting, like telling someone there's a <strong>possibility</strong> they have a serious <strong>illness</strong>.
239888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We had <strong>responsibility</strong>, which comes from the adjective<strong> responsible</strong>.
244854	It means: being in charge of someone or something, or making sure certain things happen.
250467	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We also heard <strong>possibility</strong>, which comes from the adjective<strong> possible</strong> and means that something might happen.
