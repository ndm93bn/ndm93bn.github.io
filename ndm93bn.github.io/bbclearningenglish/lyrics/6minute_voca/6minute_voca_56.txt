16111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hi! I'm Finn.
18222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And I'm Catherine. Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Today we're talking about false friends.
24910	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But false friends aren't people! False friends are words that look or sound the same in two different languages - but have different meanings in each language.
36600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right and today we'll give you plenty of examples.
40000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>...there will be a quiz of course.
42000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...and we'll also bring you a top tip for remembering these words.
45300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But first, here's Jim. He works as a student advisor, and he's talking about students' problems.
53120	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>While you're listening to Jim, try to guess what the student called Camilla's problem really was.
59700	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Jim<br></strong>Lots of students come to me with their problems, but sometimes I have to guess what they mean!
66400	Claus from Germany asked me for a <strong>rat </strong>because his father was busy in the <strong>kitchen</strong>.
72500	Simone, who's French, was worried about the <strong>buttons</strong> on her face.
78600	Camilla, from Spain, didn't know what to do because she was <strong>embarrassed</strong>.
84215	And when I helped Pierre, he said "Thank you very much, that's <strong>terrible</strong>!"
92606	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, did you guess what Camilla's problem really was?
96470	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is Camilla was actually <strong>pregnant</strong>!
99701	But she used the wrong word when she said she was <strong>embarrassed</strong>.
104500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>She did. Because <strong>embarrassed</strong> is a false friend in Spanish and English.
110695	The Spanish word <strong>embarazada</strong> means <strong>pregnant</strong>. Apologies for my Spanish pronunciation there!
119100	Spanish speaking people need to be very careful before they tell someone they are <strong>embarrassed - </strong>or that their husband is!
127700	Listen out for more false friends in this clip.
130982	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Jim<br></strong>Claus from Germany asked me for a <strong>rat </strong>because his father was in the<strong> kitchen</strong>.
137358	Simone, who's French, was worried about the <strong>buttons</strong> on her face.
143147	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So I'm guessing that Claus didn't really want a <strong>rat</strong>?
147976	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I don't think so, I think he wanted some <strong>advice</strong> from Jim.
153113	The German word <strong>r</strong><strong>at</strong> means <strong>advice</strong> in English.
157820	And Claus was worried because his father was in <strong>prison</strong>.
162281	The word <strong>kitchen</strong> can mean <strong>prison</strong> in German.
166032	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Confusing. And what about Simone, who said she had <strong>buttons</strong> on her face.
174946	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Indeed. In French, the word <strong>boutons</strong> means <strong>spots</strong>.
179999	So, Simone thought that the English word buttons had the same meaning.
184700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Now, let's have another clip. Pierre also said something quite strange.
190288	<strong>INSERT<br>Jim<br></strong>And when I helped Pierre, he said "Thank you very much, that's <strong>terrible</strong>!"
196700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So do you think that Jim was upset when Pierre said that? After all, Jim was trying to help.
202500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, Pierre didn't mean to be rude. But in French <strong>terrible </strong>- like terrible - can have two meanings.
210900	It can mean <strong>very bad</strong>, but it can also mean <strong>great</strong>. It depends on the sound of your voice when you say it.
219350	Pierre meant that Jim's advice was <strong>great, </strong>not <strong>terrible</strong>.
224226	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Wow, big misunderstanding. So the message is: don't get upset if someone from another country says something that seems a bit strange or perhaps rude.
234300	They might just be using a word that's a false friend.
237831	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Exactly. And be very careful yourself when you're speaking in another language.
243018	You know, there was this one time, I was in a hotel in France and I asked for a <strong>cushion</strong> - I thought that meant a cushion - for my bed.
253700	But it sounded like the French word <strong>couchon</strong> which means <strong>pig</strong>!
258896	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So you asked for a pig for your bedroom!
263057	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
270200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's time for a quiz! Today, we're going to play a guessing game.
275705	So number one: If a French man is holding some Â£10 notes in his hand but he says that he's got no money, what does he mean?
285962	<strong>Finn<br></strong>The answer is that he means he's got no coins.
291170	Yes, <strong>monnaie</strong> in French means <strong>coins</strong> or <strong>change.
295801	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Very good. And number two: If a German woman in an English restaurant says that she wants to <strong>become</strong> a steak, is she joking - or does she really want to turn into a meal?
307400	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Well, the answer is neither.
311070	<strong> Bekommen </strong>in German is a false friend for<strong> become </strong>in English<strong>. </strong>She means that she wants to get a steak to eat.
320000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right then. Number three: If someone from the US invites you to a party, Finn, and tells you to wear <strong>pants</strong>, should you be shocked?
328900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, actually, no, you shouldn't.
332333	<strong>Pants</strong> in American English means <strong>trousers</strong>. It doesn't mean <strong>underwear</strong> like in British English!
339500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's a relief! And that's the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them all right.
344283	And before we go, here's a vocabulary tip. Keep a note of false friends between your language and English.
350200	You could use word cards, with the word on one side and the information with example sentences on the other.
