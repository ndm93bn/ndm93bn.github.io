13801	<strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. I'm Catherineâ€¦
17777	<strong>Finn</strong><br> And I'm Finn. And Catherine, I see you've got a new phone there. Was it <strong>expensive</strong>?
24100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It was a bit <strong>pricey</strong>, Finn, but not as <strong>dear</strong> as my last one. But, do you like it?
28200	<strong>Finn<br></strong>I love it. I'm a little bit jealous.
30266	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is nice, isn't it?
31555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we used three words there: <strong>expensive</strong>, <strong>pricey </strong>and <strong>dear</strong> and they're all synonyms.
38988	They all mean that something cost a lot of money and they're the topic of this programme.
43777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. Synonyms are words that have the same or similar meanings.
48555	And English speakers use a lot of synonyms, so it's good to learn a few.
52900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It certainly is. We'll give you lots of them in this programme.
55700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We'll give you a quizâ€¦
56688	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ and a top tip for improving your vocabulary using synonyms.
61222	<strong>Catherine</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> So, let's start by listening to Rob and Mike discussing a television advert.
66000	<strong>Finn</strong><br> Think about this question while you listen: what kind of pet do Mike's kids have â€“ and what was <strong>strange </strong>about it?
74599	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Mike<br></strong>You know that <strong>funny</strong> advert where the vet thinks he's dealing with a dead cat but it's really a furry hat?
80800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh yeah, it's <strong>hilarious</strong>. That <strong>look</strong> on the vet's face is so <strong>comical</strong> and the girl's <strong>expression</strong> when she picks up her hat is <strong>priceless</strong>!
89222	<strong>Mike</strong><br><strong>Strange </strong>thing is the same thing happened to me â€“ quite<strong> bizarre </strong>actually â€“ I was holding the kids' hamster while they were cleaning the cage.
97500	I thought it was a bit <strong>odd </strong>because it wasn't moving. My daughter gave me a<strong> weird </strong>look and asked why I was stroking one of her gloves!
106222	<strong>STING</strong>
107715	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> So, what kind of pet do Mike's kids have â€“ and what was <strong>strange </strong>about it?
113222	<strong>Finn</strong><br> It was quite strange. The answer is: they have a hamster â€“ but Mike thought it was a bit <strong>odd</strong>,because it wasn't moving.
121123	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now<strong> strange </strong>and <strong>odd </strong>are synonyms. They both mean <strong>unusual</strong>.
126906	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Listen to this clip for two more words that Mike uses to mean strange or unusual.
133111	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong><strong>Mike<br></strong><strong>Strange </strong>thing is the same thing happened to me â€“ quite<strong> bizarre </strong>actually â€“ I was holding the kids' hamster while they were cleaning the cage.
141333	I thought it was a bit <strong>odd </strong>because it wasnâ€™t moving.
144777	My daughter gave me a<strong> weird </strong>look and asked why I was stroking one of her gloves!
149942	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we heard the word <strong>bizarre</strong>,spelt<strong> b-i-z-a-r-r-e</strong>,which means strange and difficult to explain.
159600	Mike thought the situation was bizarre. We also heard <strong>weird</strong>, spelt <strong>w-e-i-r-d</strong>, which also means very unusual.
170911	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's listen to another clip with some more synonyms. And this time try to spot three words that mean <strong>funny</strong>.
177777	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Mike<br></strong>You know that <strong>funny</strong> advert where the vet thinks he's dealing with a dead cat but it's really a furry hat?
183800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Oh yeah, it's <strong>hilarious</strong>. That <strong>look</strong> on the vetâ€™s face is so <strong>comical</strong> and the girl's <strong>expression</strong> when she picks up her hat is <strong>priceless</strong>!
192222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So <strong>hilarious</strong>,<strong> comical</strong> and <strong>priceless </strong>are all synonyms of<strong> funny</strong>.
198300	But they mean funny in a slightly different way: <strong>hilarious</strong> means very funny, in the sense that it makes you laugh out loud, <strong>comical</strong> means funny in a silly wayâ€¦
210222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and<strong> priceless </strong>can mean extremely funny. We usually only use it with this meaning when we're speaking.
218004	There are some other synonyms of funny, too, including<strong> humorous</strong> and<strong> amusing</strong>.
223444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And in the clip we heard two noun synonyms â€“ <strong>look</strong> and <strong>expression</strong>, both meaning the way someone shows on their face what they are thinking or feeling.
235200	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br> You're listening to BBC Learning English.
241888	<strong>Finn</strong><br> And we're talking about synonyms. Like <strong>strange</strong> and <strong>odd</strong>â€¦
246111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and <strong>funny</strong> and <strong>amusing</strong>.
247999	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now a word of warning â€“ we can't always use any synonym to replace a word â€“ it depends on the context and what exactly we're trying to say.
257333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right. So, for example, at the beginning of the programme, I said that my new phone was <strong>pricey</strong>, spelt <strong>p-r-i-c-e-y</strong>, and I also used the word <strong>dear</strong>, spelt<strong> d-e-a-r</strong>.
272222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And both words are synonyms of <strong>expensive</strong>. But <strong>pricey</strong> is more informal and more modern than <strong>dear</strong>.
281125	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So you won't see those written down very much.
284222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Not much, no. And our top tip for learning vocabulary is: use a thesaurus, which is a dictionary of synonyms, to help you find new words and make your English more interesting.
297000	And look for example sentences with each word to help you choose the right word for each situation.
303555	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> And now, it's time for a quiz.
307444	Which is the odd one out? Number 1: a) expensive, b) dear, c) cheap.
316533	<strong>Finn</strong><br> That one is c) <strong>cheap</strong>, because the other two mean <strong>costing a lot money</strong>.
323333	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br> Very good. And number two: a) bizarre, b) hilarious, c) weird.
331935	<strong>Finn</strong> <br> And the answer is b)<strong> hilarious</strong>.
335700	Because <strong>bizarre</strong> and<strong> weird</strong> are both synonyms of <strong>strange</strong>.
339222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Number three: a) humorous, b) hilarious, c) expression.
346511	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer to that is c)<strong> expression</strong>, because the other two are both synonyms of funny.
355060	<strong>Catherine</strong><br> And that's the end of the quiz â€“ well done if you got them right.
358400	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well done indeed. There's more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.
