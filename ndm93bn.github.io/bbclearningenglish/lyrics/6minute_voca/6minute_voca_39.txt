12444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Neil.
17000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And me, Finn. In this programme we're talking about phrases from Shakespeare.
24444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>They're phrases that were either invented by Shakespeare or used by him in his plays and that we still use a lot today.
31777	We'll give you plenty of examples of these and we'll teach you what they mean.
35900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We'll have a quiz; and we'll also bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.
43800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Let's start with Danny. He's talking about cooking, and entertaining friends.
49800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And while you listen, think about this question: Does Danny think it's easy to find special ingredients for recipes?
59600	<strong>Danny<br></strong>For some people food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong> and I have friends who, whenever I visit, produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>!
69666	But in my opinion, cooking<strong> is not for the faint-hearted</strong>.
73855	I really hate spending <strong>forever and a day</strong> in the kitchen.
78037	Dinner parties usually mean trying to track down some special ingredient, which ends up being <strong>a wild-goose chase</strong>.
85909	It's pretty much <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong> that my chosen recipe won't work out as I hope.
93000	So I just throw a party once a year to repay all my friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>.
99175	Fortunately, every one of them <strong>has a</strong> <strong>heart of gold</strong>, so they understand!
105555	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That was Danny. And we asked you: Does Danny think it's easy to find special ingredients for recipes?
113333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is no, because usually it's <strong>a wild-goose chase</strong>.
118777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now <strong>a wild-goose chase </strong>is used in Romeo and Juliet.
123111	This means a situation where you waste time chasing after something that you can't get.
128333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So Danny clearly has had bad experiences of trying to find ingredients and not succeeding.
135833	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Exactly. Well, there are four more Shakespearean phrases in our first clip. Listen out for them!
142700	<strong>CLIP 1 <br></strong>For some people food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong> and I have friends who, whenever I visit, produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>!
152555	But in my opinion, cooking <strong>is</strong> <strong>not for the faint-hearted</strong>.
156999	I really hate spending <strong>forever and a day</strong> in the kitchen.
161333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So food is <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong>.
166356	That's the beginning and ending of everything, which means it's the most important thing.
171777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that's why they always produce <strong>a dish fit for the gods</strong>.
176485	Clearly if something is suitable for the gods, it is the best possible.
180800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But cooking <strong>is</strong> <strong>not for the faint-hearted</strong>, Danny says.
186111	<strong>The faint-hearted</strong> are people who lack courage or determination and he thinks people like that shouldn't cook.
193000	This phrase shows how difficult Danny finds cooking.
196444	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And he hates spending a long time in the kitchen.
199666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>He does. <strong>Forever and a day</strong> is a very long time!
203742	Right, there are three more phrases coming up in our next clip.
208666	<strong>CLIP 2<br></strong>It's pretty much <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong> that my chosen recipe won't work out as I hope.
215444	So I throw a party once a year to repay all my friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>.
221777	Fortunately, every one of them has <strong>a</strong> <strong>heart of gold</strong>, so they understand!
227222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Now, if something is <strong>a foregone conclusion</strong>, it's a result that is certain to happen.
234111	He thinks it's certain that his recipe won't work out.
237500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And that's why he entertains his friends <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>.
242222	Now if you deal with things <strong>in one fell swoop</strong>, that means you deal with them all together and suddenly, like a bird sweeping down through the air to attack something.
253588	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, he doesn't want to cook for people more often than necessary! But fortunately his friends understand how he feels, don't they?
261777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>They do. They each <strong>have a heart of gold</strong>. Now that means they are very kind and caring.
267999	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
274777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And it's quiz time! Today you have to change the last three or four words of each sentence to use a phrase from Shakespeare from the programme.
287555	So number one: Some successful people don't go to university. It's really not <strong>the most important thing</strong>.
295666	Which phrase from Shakespeare can replace <strong>the most important thing</strong>?
300158	<strong>Neil<br></strong>It's really not <strong>the be-all and end-all</strong>.
303666	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Right. Number two. We got stuck in bad traffic so the journey took <strong>a very long time</strong>.
311444	So what can replace <strong>a very long time</strong>?
314666	<strong>Neil</strong><br>The journey took <strong>forever and a day</strong>.
317777	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Correct! And number three: Everyone thinks Clare is the nicest person.
324148	She's always <strong>been very kind</strong>. What can replace <strong>very kind</strong>?
