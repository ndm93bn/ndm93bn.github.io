12469	<strong>Rob <br></strong>Hi! I'm Robâ€¦
13857	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...and I'm Catherine. Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary.
19572	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Our subject for today is onomatopoeia. That means, words that sound like the thing they mean.
26565	And Catherine and I will be trying to demonstrate some of these words today.
30750	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, like that sound most people's phones make when you get a text messages.
35325	We call that sound a <strong>beep</strong>.
37053	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Beep!
37678	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's it Rob, yeah. That's onomatopoeia: the word sounds like the thing it means.
44206	<strong>Beep!
44959	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Beep beep!</strong> Yes, have I got a message? Hold on.
48064	Right, OK. There are lots of examples of onomatopoeia in the English language, and we'll take a look at some of them on today's show.
56532	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So let's start with a clip of Oliver. And he's talking about living in the city.
62450	<strong>Rob<br></strong>While you listen, try to answer this question: How does Oliver feel about city life?
68124	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Oliver<br></strong>It's too noisy for me!
70614	All the cars <strong>z</strong><strong>ooming </strong>around and <strong>honking</strong> their horns, music <strong>blaring</strong> in shops, machines <strong>buzzing</strong> and <strong>bleeping</strong>â€¦ even at night, it isn't quiet, you can still hear the fridge <strong>humming</strong>, and the <strong>rumble</strong> of the traffic outside.
83777	Then I wish I was far away from the city, sleeping in a tent, with no sound except the <strong>rustle</strong> of the wind in the trees.
90874	<strong>STING</strong>
95258	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So that's Oliver. And we asked you how he feels about city life.
99866	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And Oliver said it's too noisy for him.
103361	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I know how he feels â€“ London: same.
105852	Anyway, here's another question: what words did Oliver use to talk about the sounds of the city in the daytime? Listen again.
114776	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br></strong>All the cars <strong>zooming </strong>around and <strong>honking</strong> their horns, music <strong>blaring</strong> in shops, machines <strong>buzzing</strong> and <strong>bleeping.
122347	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Lots of lovely vocabulary there! Oliver talked about cars<strong> zooming </strong>around.
128328	<strong> Zoom, </strong>spelt&nbsp;<strong>z - o â€“ o â€“ m - </strong>is a verb, which means 'to move very quickly, making a <strong>zooming </strong>sound'.
135840	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Zoom, zoom.
137163	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Watch out!
138408	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Then he mentioned the cars <strong>honking</strong> their horns.
142523	A <strong>honk â€“ </strong>spelt<strong> h â€“ o â€“ n â€“ k -</strong> is a short, loud sound â€“ like a car horn makes.
151030	<strong>Honk honk!
154132	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, next, Oliver talked about music <strong>blaring</strong>.
157501	The verb to<strong> blare: </strong>that's<strong> b â€“ l â€“ a â€“ r â€“ e,</strong> means 'to make a loud, unpleasant sound' â€“ like music that's much too loud.
166093	<strong>Blaring</strong>!!!
166940	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>You got teenage kids Rob?
167987	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Not yet, no.
168971	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>They'll be blaring their music soon enough.
171259	OK, and Oliver also mentioned machines <strong>bleeping</strong> and <strong>buzzing.</strong> Now a <strong>bleep</strong>â€¦
177085	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Bleep bleep.
177758	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's one &nbsp;<strong>b â€“ l â€“ double e â€“ p</strong> - is a short, high sound, which electronic devices make.
185843	Something like this: <strong>Bleep, bleep, bleep.</strong> That sounds like a heart monitor.
190733	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Very good.
191502	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And a <strong>buzz -</strong> that's <strong>b â€“ u â€“ z â€“ z</strong> - is a low, continuing sound, like machines and insects make.
198730	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes. Buzzzzzzzzzzzâ€¦.
200153	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's it Rob.
200878	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Like that, yes?
200966	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done. Perfect.
201857	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Is there a bee in here?
202463	Now, the sounds of the city don't stop, even at night. Here's Oliver.
208407	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>â€¦ you can still hear the fridge <strong>humming</strong>, and the <strong>rumble</strong> of the traffic outside.
213386	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So he can hear the fridge <strong>humming</strong>.
216425	The word <strong>hum â€“ h â€“ u â€“ m - </strong>describes a low, continuous sound.
222869	And a <strong>hum</strong> [HUMMMMMMMM] is different from a <strong>buzz</strong> [BUZZZZZZZZ]!
229925	Can we listen to your hum and your buzz, Rob?
232664	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, why not? Here we go.
234170	[HUMMM] and [BUZZZ].
237464	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Is that your fridge and your bee?
239337	<strong>Rob<br></strong>That's right, yes, in that order.
240931	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Oliver also spoke about the <strong>rumble</strong> of the traffic out in the street.
245595	Now, a <strong>rumble â€“ r â€“ u â€“ m â€“ b â€“ l â€“ e -</strong> is a bit like a <strong>buzz</strong>, but there's a difference â€“ a <strong>buzz</strong> [BUZZZZZZZZZ] continues without changing, but a <strong>rumble</strong> goes up and down, like the wheels of a truck on rough ground going <strong>rumble, rumble, rumble, rumble, rumble.
267497	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Rumble</strong>. You carry on<strong> rumbling.
269305	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK.
269990	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Finally, Oliver spoke about the sound of the wind in the trees. Listen out for the word he used.
275565	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br></strong>Then I wish I was far away from the city, sleeping in a tent, with no sound except the <strong>rustle</strong> of the wind in the trees.
283811	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Rustle</strong> describes the sound of the wind, A <strong>rustle</strong> is a soft, dry, moving sound.
290788	It's spelt <strong>r â€“ u â€“ s â€“ t â€“ l â€“ e</strong>.
293955	And in pronunciation, the<strong> t</strong> is silent, so it's <strong>rustle</strong>.
297880	Rustle, rustle, rustleâ€¦
301334	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Quite a nice sound really.
302364	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thank you.
302996	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah.
304209	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>You're listening to BBC Learning English.
310113	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And our subject today is onomatopoeia â€“ words that sound like the thing they describe.
316292	&nbsp;And it's time for a quiz!
318053	Question one. Rob, what sound does a car horn make?
321717	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Easy, it's a <strong>honk</strong>!
325081	Question two: what sound does a fridge make?
328612	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And it's <strong>hum</strong>.
330766	And the last question: what sound does the wind make in the trees?
