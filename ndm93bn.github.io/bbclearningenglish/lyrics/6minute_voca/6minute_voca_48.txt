11900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Rob.
16333	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And me Sophie. And today's show is all about similar words.
21066	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, similar words - words that are close in meaning, but which we use in different ways.
27380	We'll look at what they are, what they mean and how to use them.
31555	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>We're hoping for high scores in our quiz.
34177	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And we'll leave you with a big tip for learning vocabulary.
37555	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>So, first let's listen to two architects travelling up the Burj Khalifa building in Dubai.
44333	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Here's a question to think about while you listen: what's special about this building?
49953	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>What's special about this building? Let's find out.
54420	<strong>Insert 1</strong> <br><strong>Marisa<br></strong>We've reached the top. How high are we?
57888	<strong>Jon<br></strong>We're on the 124th floor.
60055	<strong>Marisa<br></strong>Wow - so this is the tallest building in the world. It's pretty impressive.
65777	<strong>Jon<br></strong>You can really see how big the city is.
68222	And also what a large number of construction projects are happening here.
72011	<strong>Marisa<br></strong>So why did we come here today?
74555	<strong>Jon<br></strong>Well, I've got some big ideas about our next building project that I want to discuss!
85066	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, Jon and Marisa are architects. And we asked you: what's special about the Burj Khalifa?
92333	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the answer is: it's the tallest building in the world.
96666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And 'tall' is one of today's <strong>similar words</strong>.
99777	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>That's right, and 'high' is another.
102999	These words have a similar meaning - they describe something that is more than average height.
108977	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So what's the difference, Sophie?
111444	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>We usually use 'high' for things that are wider than their vertical height, for example, high mountains or a high wall.
120655	And we use 'tall' for things that are narrower than their vertical height, like people or trees.
127666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Or buildings - as we heard just now. Buildings with many floors often have greater height than width, like the Burj Khalifa.
136199	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>That's right. But we can also talk about 'high buildings': <em>Sherlock Holmes fell from the top of a high building.
144279	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Context is always important for choosing the right word.
148081	We use 'high' in this sentence because it's the position of the top of the building that's important - not the building as a whole.
156111	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Great explanation, Sherlock. Another example?
159444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK. 'Big' and 'large'. These words both mean something that is more than average size.
166999	In general, we use 'big' more often than 'large' - and we use it to talk about real things, like 'big cities', and abstract things, like 'big ideas'.
177333	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>What's your big idea for today, Rob?
179777	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Well, my big idea of the day is world peace.
184432	You hear about so much death and destruction in the news I really think that world peace is what we should be aiming for.
191339	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Well, that is a big idea - big because unfortunately it's quite an abstract idea, which is why we say big idea and not large idea. So, when do we use large?
204666	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well, we use 'large' when we want to sound more formal, for example, <em>Dubai has the largest population in the United Arab Emirates.
214333	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>We also use 'large' in some fixed expressions.
218237	Jon talks about Dubai having 'a large number of construction projects' in progress.

241222	<strong>Rob<br></strong><em>'</em>Big' for real and abstract things: <em>big city</em>, <em>big house</em>, <em>big decision</em>, <em>big ideas</em>.
249371	'Large' for real things with a more formal tone: <em>a</em> <em>large population, a large number of projects</em>, <em>a large amount of money</em>.
259545	<strong>Sophie<br></strong><em>High </em>and<em> tall.</em> Meaning more than average height.
263972	<strong>Rob<br></strong>'High' for things that are wider than their vertical height: <em>high mountains</em>, <em>high wall, high windows, high bookshelf</em>.

282999	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Thanks Rob! And remember that context is very important!
287810	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thank you Sophie. And now it's quiz time.
290515	Is the English in these sentences right or wrong?
294888	Number 1: <em>My brother is 180cm high.
300150	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the answer is: Wrong. <em>He's 180cm tall.
306287	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Number 2. <em>I looked down from the high window to the garden below.
312000	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And the answer is: Right<em>.</em>And finally, number 3.
318031	<em>Moving house is a large decision to make.
321674	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And the answer is: Wrong. It's <em>a big decision!
327449	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And that brings us almost to the end of the programme.
