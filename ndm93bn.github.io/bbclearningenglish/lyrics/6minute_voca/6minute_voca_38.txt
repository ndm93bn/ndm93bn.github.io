16299	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And Iâ€™m Catherine.
17444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In todayâ€™s programme weâ€™re talking about irregular verbs.
21499	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, and as you know, there are lots of irregular verbs in English.
25500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Lots and lots. Some, like <strong>write</strong>, have different forms for the past simple and past participle: <strong>wrote </strong>and <strong>written</strong>.
35543	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes and it's not always easy to remember all those different forms!
39900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It's not. Today, though, weâ€™re going to explain how some of these verbs can be grouped into patterns to help remember the different forms.
49155	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Weâ€™ll give you lots of examplesâ€¦
51222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Weâ€™ll have a quizâ€¦&nbsp;
52388	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦and weâ€™ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
55499	<strong>Finn<br></strong>But first, letâ€™s hear my interview with singer-songwriter Andrea.
60333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Who hasnâ€™t spoken to Andrea for a long time?
68109	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Finn<br></strong>Hi, Andrea. Now, tell us: when did you <strong>begin</strong> to <strong>sing</strong>?
72797	<strong>Andrea</strong><br>I <strong>sang</strong> in the school choir and I <strong>began</strong> to sing in bands when I was just ten.
78300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Oh, wow. So how many songs have you <strong>written</strong>&nbsp;
81900	<strong>Andrea</strong><br>Over a hundred. I <strong>wrote</strong> one just before I <strong>drove</strong> here.
86999	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Right. And Andrea, I'm sure you have <strong>broken</strong> many menâ€™s hearts. Tell us, who was the first?
94555	<strong>Andrea</strong><br>Oh, he was a boy called Marcus. I <strong>knew</strong> him at school.
99046	We <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street. Heâ€™s not <strong>spoken</strong> to me since we <strong>broke</strong> up.
103999	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Since you broke up, that sounds bad. Thank you for coming and speaking to us today, Andrea.
109300	<strong>Andrea</strong><br>Thanks for having me.
110303	<strong>STING</strong>
112777	<strong>Finn</strong><br>And there we are. So, we asked you: Who hasnâ€™t spoken to Andrea for a long time?
119814	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And the answer is: Marcus. They havenâ€™t spoken since they <strong>broke</strong> up.
124066	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Broke </strong>is the past simple of the verb <strong>break</strong> and it belongs to our first group of verbs.
130789	It has the pattern <strong>break</strong>, <strong>broke</strong>,<strong> broken</strong>.
135111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, the past simple is <strong>broke</strong> and the past participle is <strong>broken</strong>.
139500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Listen to this clip. Can you hear another verb with the same pattern?
144146	Hereâ€™s a clue. The word rhymes with <strong>broken</strong>.
148200	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1</strong> <br><strong>Andrea</strong><br>Oh, he was a boy called Marcus. I <strong>knew</strong> him at school.
152444	We <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street. Heâ€™s not <strong>spoken</strong> to me since we <strong>broke</strong> up.
157333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK, and <strong>spoken </strong>rhymes with <strong>broken</strong>.
161001	The verb <strong>speak</strong> forms its past simple and past participle in the same way as <strong>break</strong>.
166888	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So itâ€™s <strong>speak</strong>,<strong> spoke</strong>,<strong> spoken</strong>â€¦&nbsp;
171444	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And <strong>speak</strong> and <strong>break</strong> are pronounced differently although they both have e-a-k at the end.
179222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>They do. Now, another verb with the same pattern is <strong>wake</strong>.
184111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ so itâ€™s <strong>wake</strong>,<strong> woke</strong>,<strong> woken</strong>.
186666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦ although we spell <strong>wake</strong>, w-a-k-e. It's not spelt e-a-k at the end.
194333	Now, in the interview, we had two other verbs with a different pattern.
199055	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, we had the past forms <strong>knew</strong> and <strong>grew</strong>.
203444	Andrea <strong>knew</strong> Marcus at school and she <strong>grew</strong> up on the same street.
209444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes. These are the past simple forms of <strong>know</strong> and <strong>grow</strong>.
214555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So, itâ€™s <strong>know</strong>,<strong> knew</strong>,<strong> known</strong>â€¦
217613	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Grow</strong>,<strong> grew</strong>,<strong> grown</strong>â€¦&nbsp;
220555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Another verb with this pattern is <strong>blow</strong>.
223647	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So itâ€™s <strong>blow, blew, blown</strong>.
227030	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So we've got two groups. The first one is verbs like <strong>speak</strong>,<strong> spoke</strong>,<strong> spoken</strong>â€¦
233333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And we have in our second group, verbs like <strong>grow</strong>,<strong> grew</strong>,<strong> grown</strong>.
238711	Listen to this second clip and see if you can spot two more patterns.
243599	Hereâ€™s a clue: listen to words that rhyme or have similar pronunciations.
249377	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br>Finn</strong><br>When did you <strong>begin</strong> to <strong>sing</strong>
251414	<strong>Andrea</strong><br>I <strong>sang</strong> in the school choir and I <strong>began</strong> to sing in bands when I was just ten.
257000	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Oh, wow. How many songs have you <strong>written</strong>?
260444	<strong>Andrea</strong><br>Over a hundred. I <strong>wrote</strong> one just before I <strong>drove</strong> here.
265556	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Did you hear the patterns <strong>begin</strong>â€¦<strong> began </strong>and<strong> sing</strong>â€¦<strong> sang?
270977	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, this pattern is <strong>begin</strong>,<strong> began</strong>,<strong> begun</strong>â€¦<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
276125	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly, and we've got<strong> sing</strong>,<strong> sang</strong>,<strong> sung</strong>â€¦
279937	<strong>Finn<br></strong>In the clip, we also had another pattern - <strong>wrote</strong>â€¦ <strong>written</strong>.
285777	So, that's the past simple and the past participle of <strong>write</strong>.
290104	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>We heard another verb with this patternâ€¦ <strong>drove</strong>, which is the past simple of <strong>drive</strong>.
296445	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the past participle isâ€¦
