13300	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Callum.
16900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And me, Finn. In this programme weâ€™re talking about an interesting type of adjective.
22550	<strong><br><br>Callum<br></strong>Yes, theyâ€™re adjectives that are formed from the names of famous people such as authors, politicians and scientists. Thereâ€™ll be lots of examples.
34458	<strong>Callum<br></strong>But first, hereâ€™s Ruth. Sheâ€™s talking about some common adjectives from names that we use.
39555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And listen out for the answer to &nbsp;this question: Which adjective comes from the name of the author George Orwell? Hereâ€™s Ruth.
48600	<strong>INSERT </strong> <br><strong>Ruth<br></strong>Charles Dickens is regarded as the greatest novelist of <strong>Victorian </strong>England and many of his books describe the poverty of that time.
58222	So what do we mean by <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions?
61650	And what about an <strong>Orwellian</strong> future?
64600	Have you read the book <em>1984</em> by the author George Orwell?
68903	A <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is clearly the kind of speech made by the politician Winston Churchill.
75222	And you can probably guess which famous people these adjectives come from: <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite</strong> outlook on life.
83722	<strong>STING</strong>
89111	<strong>Callum<br></strong>So that was Ruth. And we asked you which adjective comes from the name of the author George Orwell?
96333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is <strong>Orwellian</strong>.
99108	The suffix <strong>â€“ian</strong> is often added to the names of famous writers and scientists to form new adjectives.
107660	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Now these adjectives describe something that person is famous for.
112000	Orwell wrote about a nightmare vision of the future in his book <em>1984</em>, so an <strong>Orwellian </strong>future or society is terrible like the one in the book, with no individual freedom.
125300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And people sometimes say that reality TV programmes are Orwellian because they spy on what people are doing.
133409	<strong>Callum<br></strong>And Iâ€™ve heard politiciansâ€™ views described as Orwellian too.
137100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Listen for more of these adjectives in our first clip.
140400	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1 <br></strong>Charles Dickens is regarded as the greatest novelist of <strong>Victorian </strong>England and many of his books describe the poverty of that time.
149500	So what do we mean by <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions?
153190	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now which two adjectives came from the names of famous people in that clip?
158666	<strong>Callum<br></strong>Well, there was <strong>Victorian</strong>.
161050	<strong>Victorian</strong> England means England when Queen Victoria ruled, which was from 1837 to 1901.
168800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Other queens and kings whose names are commonly used as adjectives include <strong>Elizabethan</strong>, <strong>Edwardian</strong> and <strong>Georgian.
178000	</strong><br><br><strong>Callum<br></strong>And with kings and queens itâ€™s always their first names that are made into adjectives, not their surnames.
184333	Now that clip also used the adjective <strong>Dickensian</strong>. Ruth asked us what <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions are.
192800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, well, because Charles Dickens wrote a lot about the poverty of Victorian England, <strong>Dickensian</strong> social conditions are very poor, like those in his novels.
203920	<strong>Callum<br></strong>You could also say that a street or house is <strong>Dickensian</strong>, meaning that it is very old and in poor condition. But onto our second clip.
213800	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>A <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is clearly the kind of speech made by the politician Winston Churchill.
219901	And you can probably guess which famous people these adjectives come from: <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite</strong> outlook on life.
228550	<strong>Finn<br></strong>A <strong>Churchillian </strong>speech. Now Churchill is famous for being a powerful, determined politician and a brilliant speaker.
237622	<strong>Callum<br></strong>So, a <strong>Churchillian</strong> speech is a powerful and brilliant speech.
241666	And we also heard <strong>a Freudian </strong>slip and a <strong>Thatcherite </strong>outlook on life.
247222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes. <strong>Freudian </strong>from Freud, the psychologist.
251777	Freud wrote a lot about the unconscious mind.
255222	And <strong>a Freudian slip</strong> is a fixed phrase that means a mistake that you make, especially when speaking, caused by the thoughts in your unconscious mind.
265444	<strong>Callum<br>Thatcherite</strong> comes from Margaret Thatcher, who was a Prime Minister of the UK.
269777	Adjectives from politiciansâ€™ names are often formed with the suffixes <strong>â€“ist</strong> and <strong>â€“ite</strong>.
277333	Other examples are <strong>Stalinist </strong>from the Soviet leader Josef Stalin,<strong> Maoist </strong>from the Chinese Chairman Mao and <strong>Reaganite </strong>from former US President Reagan.

301800	Number one: Which of these nouns goes best with the adjective Orwellian?
307000	a) an Orwellian society b) Orwellian freedom.

317800	<strong>Finn</strong><br>Good. Number two: Are Dickensian conditions a) the conditions in which Charles Dickens lived, or b) any poor social living conditions?
330900	<strong>Callum</strong><br>Itâ€™s b) any poor living conditions.
334400	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well done! Number three: Tony Blair was a Prime Minister of the UK and the adjective from his name is like that of Margaret Thatcher.
343666	So would we talk about a) Blairist policies or b) Blairite policies?
351888	<strong>Callum<br></strong>The answerâ€™s b) Blairite.
