13706	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Catherineâ€¦
17264	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And Iâ€™m Neil. You know, Catherine, 6 Minute Vocabulary is great because you can listen to each programme again and againâ€¦
26376	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>You can, Neil. You can <strong>reuse</strong> themâ€¦
28587	<strong>Neil</strong><br>You can! And the word <strong>reuse</strong> is a clue to todayâ€™s topicâ€¦
33220	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>It is, weâ€™re talking about prefixes â€“ those are the two or three letters we can add to the beginning of words to change their meaning â€¦
42054	<strong>Neil</strong><br>â€¦like <strong>re-</strong>, in <strong>reuse</strong>.
44373	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Weâ€™ll tell you more about <strong>re-</strong> later and weâ€™ll also tell you aboutthe prefixes <strong>pre-</strong> and <strong>pro-</strong>.
51698	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Weâ€™ll explain what all three prefixes mean and give you lots of examples.
56235	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Thereâ€™ll be a quiz at the end â€¦
57437	<strong>Neil</strong><br>â€¦ and a top tip for learning vocabulary.
60787	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>But first, letâ€™s hear from Katie. Sheâ€™s an environmental campaigner.
65844	While you listen, try to answer this question: What do teachers do with cereal boxes? Hereâ€™s Katie.
73731	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Katie</strong><br>Most food in supermarkets nowadays is <strong>prepacked</strong> in plastic and cardboard.
79847	This creates so much waste. Takeaways and <strong>precooked</strong> meals also use a lot of packaging.
86548	We have to <strong>re-educate</strong> people to cook for themselves so they donâ€™t just <strong>reheat</strong> meals â€¦ and people really need to become more <strong>proactive</strong> in <strong>recycling</strong> materials.
97369	Teachers in <strong>preschool</strong> are great at this â€“ they <strong>reuse</strong> cereal boxes to make fantastic models of robots and spaceships with the kids.
107664	<strong>STING</strong>
110201	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So we asked you: What do teachers do with cereal boxes?
114203	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is: They <strong>reuse</strong> them to make models of robots and spaceships.
120202	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Thatâ€™s right. They make something new with the boxes.
123434	But instead of saying â€˜they use the boxes againâ€™, Katie said the word <strong>reuse</strong>.
130617	Now, the prefix <strong>re</strong>-, spelt <strong>r-e</strong>, in front of a word means <strong>again.
137249	<strong>Neil</strong><br>So <strong>re</strong>- plus <strong>use</strong> means use again.
141891	We also had <strong>re</strong>- plus <strong>cycling</strong>, which also means <strong>to use again</strong>.
147860	Listen out for more words with <strong>re</strong>- in this clip.
151400	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>We have to <strong>re-educate</strong> people to cook for themselves so they donâ€™t just <strong>reheat</strong> meals.
156827	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Katie used the word <strong>re-educate</strong>.
159539	Thatâ€™s <strong>re</strong>-, which means <strong>again,</strong> plus <strong>educate</strong>, so <strong>re-educate</strong> means <strong>educate again.
166541	</strong> And in this case,<strong> re-educate</strong> means <strong>teach people to behave in a different way</strong> so they start to cook for themselves.
174144	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Another other word with <strong>re</strong>- was <strong>reheat</strong>.
177637	Thatâ€™s <strong>re</strong>- plus <strong>heat</strong>, making <strong>reheat</strong>, which means <strong>heat again</strong>.
183202	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Letâ€™s have another clip. See if you can spot a different prefix.
187717	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2</strong> <br>Most food in supermarkets nowadays is <strong>prepacked</strong> in plastic and cardboard.
193386	Takeaways and <strong>precooked</strong> meals also use a lot of packaging.
197475	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>We heard <strong>prepacked</strong> and <strong>precooked</strong>.
201020	Both start with <strong>pre</strong>-, spelt <strong>p-r-e</strong>, which means <strong>before</strong> or <strong>already.
208715	So a lot of the food in supermarkets is already packed in cardboard and plastic â€“ itâ€™s <strong>prepacked</strong>.
216020	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And you can buy meals that have been made and cooked before you buy them.
221143	<strong>Pre</strong>- plus <strong>cooked</strong> means <strong>already cooked</strong>â€¦
224339	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And the children Katie talked about were in <strong>preschool</strong>.
227871	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Thatâ€™s <strong>pre</strong>- plus <strong>school</strong>, thatâ€™s <strong>preschool</strong>.
231823	Itâ€™s a place children go before they go to proper school.
235847	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So thatâ€™s <strong>re</strong>- and <strong>pre</strong>-.
237909	Now letâ€™s talk about <strong>pro</strong>-, spelt <strong>p-r-o</strong>.
242617	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Katie said people need to be more <strong>proactive</strong> in recycling.
247209	<strong>Pro</strong>- means <strong>in support of</strong> or <strong>in favour of</strong> something.
252483	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>So being <strong>proactive</strong>: <strong>pro</strong>- plus <strong>active</strong> - in <strong>recycling</strong> means making more effort to recycle things.
261558	Neil, are you a proactive recycler?
264397	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Yeah. Well, weâ€™ve got two bins.
265995	One for recycling and one for all the food. So, I suppose I am.
269825	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Very good.
270678	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Now, another word with the prefix <strong>pro</strong>- that is used a lot when talking about food is <strong>probiotic</strong>.
278165	<strong>Probiotics</strong> are good bacteria that help to keep you healthy.
282753	<strong>IDENT</strong><br>Youâ€™re listening to BBC Learning English.
290170	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And weâ€™re talking about the prefixes <strong>re</strong>-, <strong>pre</strong>- and <strong>pro</strong>-.
294891	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And now for a quiz.
297504	Number one: Which prefix goes before the word school to make the word for a place for very young children.
304964	Is it a) <strong>re</strong>- b) <strong>pre</strong>- or c) <strong>pro</strong>-?
310277	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is b) <strong>pre:</strong> itâ€™s <strong>preschool</strong>.
315856	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Good. Number two: What would you do with a ready-made meal?
320697	Would you a) <strong>preheat</strong> it b) <strong>reheat</strong> it or c) <strong>proheat</strong> it?
328123	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is b) <strong>re:</strong> thatâ€™s <strong>reheat</strong> it.
333023	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Great. And, number three: If you want to improve your English, should you be a) <strong>reactive</strong>, b) <strong>preactive</strong> or c) <strong>proactive</strong> when youâ€™re learning new words?
344715	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is c)itâ€™s <strong>pro</strong>: thatâ€™s <strong>proactive</strong>.
349247	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz â€“ well done if you got them right.
352293	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And now, hereâ€™s todayâ€™s top tip for learning vocabulary: try to group new words by their prefixes.
