12222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Rob.
16177	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And Iâ€™m Catherine. And today weâ€™re talking about new words.
21222	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, new words in English. Weâ€™ll look at where they come from, why we need them and who uses them.
28111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Weâ€™ll have a quiz; and weâ€™ll also bring you a top tip for learning vocabulary.
32633	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But first, hereâ€™s Iris, talking about a photograph she took.
37111	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>And hereâ€™s a question: is Iris happy with her photo?
44555	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Iris<br></strong>So hereâ€™s a <strong>selfie</strong> from a <strong>flashmob</strong> I went to â€“ thereâ€™s everyone dancing and stuff, and thatâ€™s my idiot boyfriend at the back: he decided to <strong>photobomb</strong> me!
56111	Itâ€™s quite funny thoughâ€¦ I put it on my social networks â€“ but the <strong>t</strong><strong>rolls</strong> said we looked stupid! I donâ€™t care though, I like it.
65028	<strong>STING</strong>
66999	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>So thatâ€™s Iris. And she said she liked the photo.
70666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. Now there were a few words there which are quite new in English.
74899	Letâ€™s have a look at some of them. Listen again to Iris. Two questions this time.
80066	One: what type of photo did she take and two: where was she?
86222	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1<br> </strong>So this is a <strong>selfie</strong> from a <strong>flashmob I went to</strong>â€¦
90888	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>Iris took a <strong>selfie</strong>, and she was at a <strong>flashmob</strong>.
95966	Letâ€™s take those words one at a time.
98444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, first of all, a very popular word now, <strong>selfie</strong>.
102097	Thatâ€™s a photograph you take of yourself, by holding your camera or phone out in front of you at armâ€™s length.
108555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, <strong>selfie</strong>. Take many <strong>selfies</strong> Rob?
111111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Absolutely not, no...Donâ€™t want to look at myself, thank you.
114794	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But where does the word <strong>selfie</strong> come from?
117333	Well the word <strong>self</strong>-<strong>portrait </strong>has been around for a long time.
121132	It means â€˜a picture you draw or paint of yourselfâ€™. So <strong>selfie</strong> probably comes from that.
126900	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And thatâ€™s one way words come into English.
130222	Get an old word, change it to fit a new situation and youâ€™ve got a new word like <strong>selfie</strong>.
136200	And thatâ€™s one reason why we need new words â€“ to talk about new situations, like all these self-portraits that everyoneâ€™s taking.
143666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah, good. Now another way to make a new word for a new situation is to get two old words and put them together.
150855	Iris was at a <strong>flashmob</strong>. Now, a <strong>flashmob</strong> is a crowd of people who gather together quickly and suddenly â€“ itâ€™s often organised through social media.
161000	Now the word <strong>flash</strong> can mean â€˜something that happens very quicklyâ€™, and a <strong>mob</strong> is a crowd of people.
167919	So when you put them together, youâ€™ve got the perfect new word for the situation. Ever been on a <strong>flashmob</strong> Rob?
174888	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Iâ€™m afraid not, no oneâ€™s invited me actually.
176777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Really? Iâ€™ll invite you on the next one I go on.
178800	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thank you. Anyway, youâ€™ve probably noticed that these words are mostly made by people on social media.
185333	Itâ€™s not the only place that new words come from, but a lot of new words are coming from social media at the moment.
191522	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Next example. Irisâ€™s boyfriend jumped into her <strong>selfie</strong> at the last minute.
197333	Heâ€™s actually in the photo even though she wasn't expecting him to be! And hereâ€™s the word for it:
203444	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>â€¦and thatâ€™s my idiot boyfriend at the back: he decided to <strong>photobomb</strong> me!
209617	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So: <strong>photobomb.</strong> Thatâ€™s a new word made from two old words: <strong>photo</strong>, obviously, and <strong>bomb</strong>, the thing that suddenly explodes.
219888	And weâ€™ve got similar new words like <strong>weatherbomb</strong>â€¦
222666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s a sudden period of extreme weather, and then thereâ€™s <strong>thoughtbomb </strong>where people get together and, basically â€“ think!
230600	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, thatâ€™s a new word for what we used to call â€˜brainstormâ€™.?
234333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is, yes. Very similar.
236111	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Good, right, OK. Well now, Iris used another new word to describe people who post horrible comments on social media. Listen carefully to this:
244881	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br></strong>I put it on my social networks â€“ but the <strong>t</strong><strong>rolls</strong> said we looked stupid!
250837	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>A person who posts negative comments on social media is called a <strong>troll</strong>.
256444	And <strong>troll</strong> is actually an old word for an imaginary creature â€“ a kind of monster.
261765	You find lots of trolls in old Scandinavian stories â€“ and the wordâ€™s been around in English for a long time.
268306	<strong>Catherine<br> </strong>So an old word, with a new meaning â€“ but thereâ€™s a link there to the original meaning isnâ€™t there Rob?
273444	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>Yes thatâ€™s right, because both kinds of troll are quite ugly in their own way â€“ either in their looks or behaviour.
280333	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>6 Minute Vocabulary from BBC Learning English.
287111	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>And weâ€™re talking about new words. So Catherine, have you ever been trolled?
293111	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thankfully I havenâ€™t Rob, I choose my friends very carefully on social media.
297888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right, itâ€™s quiz time! Question one: whatâ€™s the word for a group of people who gather together suddenly, and itâ€™s normally organised on social media?
308424	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Any ideas? The word is <strong>flashmob</strong>.
312444	Question two: what word means: â€˜jump into someone elseâ€™s photographâ€™?
318000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s <strong>photobomb</strong>. Finally, whatâ€™s the word for people who write nasty, negative comments online?
325115	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They are<strong> trolls</strong>. OK, well done if you got those right at home.
330555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done indeed. And now hereâ€™s a vocabulary tip.
333606	To keep your English right up-to-date, join some social media groups where people use English.
338999	Social media is a great place to pick up words and expressions that are in use, even though theyâ€™re not in the dictionary.
345887	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, and new words are being invented all the time arenâ€™t they?
348555	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>They are, yes.
349444	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well thereâ€™s more about this at bbclearningenglish.com.
