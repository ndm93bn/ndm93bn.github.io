12483	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary.
15451	My name is Catherine, and I'm here today with our special guest presenter Doug.
19754	Welcome to the show Doug.
20869	<strong>Doug<br></strong>Hi Catherine, how are you?
22121	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I'm fine thank you. How are you Doug?
23880	<strong>Doug<br></strong>Fine.
24498	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>Tell us a bit about yourself Doug - you're originally from Canada, right?
28231	<strong>Doug<br></strong>Yes, I'm from Vancouver, which is in western Canada, but I moved here a long, long time ago.
34771	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But you've still got an American English accent I noticed.
37250	<strong>Doug<br></strong>Yes, I haven't lost that.
38866	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And that's cool, because this show is all about the differences between British English and American English vocabulary.
46376	So, tell me Doug, do Canadians like you speak American English?
52109	<strong>Doug<br></strong>I don't think Canadians would say that.
54388	Let's say they speak North American English. But it is very similar.
59914	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So American English and British English aren't really that different; I'm British and me and Doug can understand each other perfectly - yes?
70421	<strong>Doug<br></strong>Yes, usually. No, of course we can.
73423	Of course we understand you.
74907	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>We can. But there are a few vocabulary differences between American and British English that it's very helpful to learn.
82158	And today, with Doug's help, we're going to take you through some of them. So, over to you Doug.
88051	<strong>Doug <br></strong>OK, thanks Catherine. Let's start with some examples.
91127	This is John, from the US, talking about his recent visit to Britain.
95614	Here's a question for you while youâ€™re listening: Did John enjoy his visit? Here's John.
102272	<strong>INSERT John<br></strong>I went to Britain for two weeks last <strong>fall</strong>.
105728	Actually, British people don't say <strong>fall</strong>, they say <strong>autumn</strong>.
110179	In the States we pay the <strong>check</strong>, but in Britain they pay the <strong>bill</strong>.
115898	we<strong> mail</strong> a letter, but the British <strong>post </strong>a letter.
120122	we go to a <strong>store</strong> to buy <strong>candy</strong> and <strong>cookies</strong>, but the British go to a <strong>shop</strong> to buy <strong>sweets </strong>and<strong> biscuits</strong>.
127814	But I had a great time there.
134526	<strong>Doug </strong><br>So, the question was: according to John, did he enjoy his visit?
139790	<strong>Catherine </strong><br>And the answer is: yes, he did. He said he had a great time.
143771	Well done if you got that right at home.
145938	Now, let's have a closer look at some of the vocabulary John used.
151319	Here's a clip, and another question for you: what's the name of the season after summer?
158133	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1 <br></strong>Actually British people don't say <strong>fall</strong>, they say <strong>autumn</strong>.
162484	<strong>Catherine <br></strong>So, in Britain the season after summer is called <strong>autumn</strong>.
167387	<strong>Doug <br></strong>Yes, but in American English it's called <strong>fall because the leaves fall</strong>.
173490	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Fall.
176216	<strong>Doug<br></strong>Next question: when you're in a restaurant, and you've finished the meal, what do you ask for, what do you pay?
182698	Listen again:
184079	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2 <br></strong>In the States we pay the <strong>check</strong>, but in Britain they pay the <strong>bill</strong>.
189407	<strong>Doug <br></strong>In America, the word is <strong>check</strong>.
193102	You pay the <strong>check</strong> at the end of a meal.
195309	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>You pay the check.
196750	But in Britain, we pay the <strong>bill</strong>.
199632	<strong>Doug</strong> <br>Here's another difference between British and American English: what do we do when we 'send a letter'?
205804	Can you remember the British word, or the American word, or both?
209440	Listen again:
210744	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3 <br></strong>.
211365	we<strong> mail</strong> a letter, but the British <strong>post </strong>a letter.
214521	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>So, in Britain we <strong>post</strong> a letter, but Doug, North Americans say.?
219910	<strong>Doug<br></strong><strong>Mail</strong> a letter.
221354	OK, now, John said that British people go to a <strong>shop</strong> to buy <strong>sweets </strong>and<strong> biscuits</strong>.
228228	Well, where do Americans go, and what do they buy there?
232779	Listen one more time:
234195	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 5<br></strong>...we go to a <strong>store</strong> to buy <strong>candy </strong>and<strong> cookies</strong>.
237937	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The British say <strong>shop</strong>.
239900	<strong>Doug</strong> <br>...but the Americans say <strong>store</strong>.
242593	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...the British say <strong>sweets</strong>.
244375	<strong>Doug</strong> <br>...but the Americans say <strong>candy</strong>.
246936	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...the British say <strong>biscuits</strong>.
248990	<strong>Doug</strong> <br>and in North America, that's <strong>cookies.

259113	<strong>Doug <br></strong>And our topic for today is British and American vocabulary.
262755	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Doug - a question for you: A lot of learners of English want to know which one is better - is it British English or American English?
270725	What do you think?
271573	<strong>Doug<br></strong>To be honest, there's no difference - just use the one you like.
275482	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now it's time for a quiz.
277785	Doug is going to say an American English word, and you have to say the British English word with the same meaning.
284266	<strong>Doug</strong> <br>OK, so, the first American English word is <strong>check</strong>.
289217	What's the British word for <strong>check</strong>?
292334	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And the answer is: <strong>bill</strong>.
294905	<strong>Doug</strong> <br>Next word: <strong>candy</strong>.
297512	What do British people say instead of <strong>candy</strong>?
301663	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br>And the British word for <strong>candy </strong>is<strong> sweets</strong>.
305497	<strong>Doug</strong> <br>Good, and the last American word is <strong>mail</strong>.
309364	What's the British word for <strong>mail</strong>?
312501	<strong>Catherine</strong> <br> The British word for <strong>mail</strong> is <strong>post</strong>.
315371	And that's all our questions for today.
321084	Before we go, here's a tip to help you with your vocabulary studies.
326473	<strong>Doug</strong> <br>Yes - people speak English with many different accents: Australian, Indian, Nigerian, Singaporean, West Indian.
