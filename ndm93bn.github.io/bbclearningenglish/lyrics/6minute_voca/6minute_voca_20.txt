1	(Introduction...)
12600	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Neilâ€¦
16979	<strong>Finn</strong><br>And Iâ€™m Finn. In this programme weâ€™re looking at three prefixes: <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>, <strong>dys-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-y-s </strong>and <strong>dis-</strong>,spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>.
30600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Prefixes â€“ or prefixes, as some people say - are two or three letters that go at the beginning of a word and affect its meaning.
39050	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Weâ€™ll look at what each prefix means and give you example sentencesâ€¦
43600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thereâ€™ll be a quiz â€¦
44900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦and weâ€™ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
48700	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But first, letâ€™s listen to Gladys talking about her husband Bert.
54000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>While you listen, think about this question: Does Gladys agree with Bertâ€™s doctor?
60000	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Gladys<br></strong>Bertâ€™s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment.
65000	Itâ€™s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>.
67896	The doctor says itâ€™s because he eats too much fatty food.
71800	She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet.
76600	No <strong>disrespect </strong>to the doctor, but I <strong>disagree</strong> - I think itâ€™s caused by stress.
82272	<strong>Neil</strong><br>So we asked you: Does Gladys agree with the doctor?
87300	<strong>Finn</strong><br>And the answer is: No, she <strong>disagrees.
90900	Gladys thinks her husbandâ€™s indigestion is caused by stress, but the doctor thinks itâ€™s due to a bad diet.
99140	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Disagree</strong> is the key word because it has the prefix <strong>dis</strong>, spelt <strong>d-i-s</strong>.
107550	This means not. So by adding <strong>dis,</strong> we can turn a word into its opposite.
114200	So <strong>dis - agree</strong> means not to agree â€¦
117600	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦and <strong>dis - respect</strong> means not having respect.
121900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Gladys says <strong>No disrespect to the doctor </strong>â€“ meaning she doesnâ€™t want people to think she doesnâ€™t respect what the doctor says<strong>.
129904	Letâ€™s hear another clip from Gladys with more prefixes.
134300	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>Bertâ€™s <strong>dyspepsia</strong>, or indigestion, is quite bad at the moment.
139840	Itâ€™s causing him quite a bit of <strong>discomfort</strong>.
143000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we had <strong>discomfort.</strong>If you know what the word <strong>comfort</strong> meansâ€¦
149262	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ then you can work out what <strong>discomfort </strong>means: <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>comfort</strong> give us the opposite of comfort: Bertâ€™s feeling uncomfortable.
159287	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And in the clip, we heard the word <strong>dyspepsia</strong> â€“ thatâ€™s the medical word for indigestion, when your stomach feels very full and uncomfortable after you eat.
170900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>This word starts with the prefix <strong>dys</strong>, but this time itâ€™s spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>.
176951	<strong>Finn<br></strong>This prefix is less common than <strong>dis</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>, but it also has a negative meaning â€“ it has the idea of being bad or abnormal.
188000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So <strong>dyspepsia </strong>is a medical condition when your body canâ€™t process food in the normal way.
194583	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Other words with the prefix <strong>dys-</strong> , spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>, are <strong>dyslexia </strong>and <strong>dysfunctional.</strong>
202192	People who have <strong>dyslexia</strong> have difficulty with readingâ€¦
206039	<strong>Neil<br></strong>â€¦ and if something is <strong>dysfunctional</strong>, it doesnâ€™t work properly.
210760	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Letâ€™s have another clip with the prefix <strong>dis-</strong>, <strong>d-i-s</strong>.
214968	Weâ€™ll also hear our next prefix.
217523	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>She says the symptoms would <strong>disappear</strong> if Bert went on a <strong>detox</strong> diet.
223000	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, we had <strong>disappear</strong> - thatâ€™s <strong>dis-</strong> plus <strong>appear</strong>â€¦
228766	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, and <strong>disappear</strong>, means the opposite of <strong>appear.
233097	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We also had the word <strong>detox</strong>, which starts with the prefix <strong>de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>.
239666	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, the prefix <strong>de-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-e</strong>, usually means take away or remove something â€¦
245901	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So, if something is described as a <strong>detox</strong>, <strong>de-tox</strong>, it means it takes away toxins or poisons.
254200	A <strong>detox</strong> diet could be one with just fruit and vegetables.
257800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I like to <strong>detox</strong> at the end of the day with a hot bath.
261800	<strong>IDENT</strong> <br>6 Minute Vocabulary from the BBC.
267522	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about the prefixes<strong> dis-</strong>,spelt<strong> d-i-s</strong>;<strong> dys</strong>,spelt <strong>d-y-s</strong>; and<strong> de-</strong>, spelt <strong>d-e</strong>.
278700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>All these prefixes have a negative meaning.
282200	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And now itâ€™s quiz time. Choose the correct word.
287596	Number one: One minute the dogs were playing in the garden.
292618	The next minute the garden was empty and theyâ€™d all a) disagreed b) disappeared c) detoxed.
304189	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well, the answer to that is b) <strong>disappeared</strong>.
308600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Number two. People who drink too much alcohol sometimes go to a clinic for a a) dyspepsia b) discomfort c) detox.
323444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>The answer is c) <strong>detox</strong>.
327000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And number three: My daughter is having problems learning to read.
331400	Her teacher thinks she may be a) disrespectful b) dyslexic c) dysfunctional.
340418	<strong>Finn</strong><br>The answer is b) <strong>dyslexic</strong>.
344425	And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz. Well done if you got them right.
347400	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Yes, well done. And now, hereâ€™s our top tip for learning vocabulary: when you see or hear a new word, see if you can break the word up - if it starts with a prefix that you recognise, it may help you to understand the meaning.
