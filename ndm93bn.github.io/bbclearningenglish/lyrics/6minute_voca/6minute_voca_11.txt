12367	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherineâ€¦
16435	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And me, Rob. Hello.
17826	In this show weâ€™re going to <strong>find out about</strong> multi-word verbs.
21194	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right: weâ€™re <strong>looking</strong> <strong>into</strong> verb phrases that are <strong>made up of</strong> more than one word.
26300	And if youâ€™d like an example, Rob and I have used three of them already.
30864	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Itâ€™s incredible: we have! Catherine you said <strong>looking into</strong> and <strong>made up of</strong>.
36185	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yep, and Rob you said <strong>find out about</strong>.
39270	And some people call this type of multi-word verb a phrasal verb.
43446	<strong>Rob<br></strong>They do. And in this programme, weâ€™ll look at lots of multi-word verbsâ€¦
47706	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>â€¦ weâ€™ll explain what they mean â€¦
49215	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thereâ€™ll be a quiz â€¦
50211	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And weâ€™ll leave you with a top tip for learning vocabulary.
53731	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So, letâ€™s get started by listening to Andre â€“ a student from France who is studying in London.
60877	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yep, and heâ€™s talking about his weekend.
63250	And here are two questions for you while you listen. First, did Andre meet up with his friends?
69885	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And second, Andreâ€™s English is pretty good, but it sounds a bit unnatural.
74939	Why is that? Hereâ€™s Andre.
77119	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Andre<br></strong>I wanted to <strong>rendezvous</strong> with friends at the shopping centre, but I couldnâ€™t find them.
83923	In the end, I <strong>abandoned</strong> the day. They said they couldnâ€™t find me, but I think they just <strong>invented</strong> a story!
97055	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thank you, Andre. And we asked you if Andre managed to meet his friends.
101691	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And sadly he didnâ€™t. He said he abandoned the day.
105984	Well done if you got that at home. But why did Andreâ€™s English sound unnatural?
111292	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, we could understand him OK, but some of the words he used were a little bit too formal for everyday natural spoken English.
119642	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Yes, thats right. When weâ€™re speaking, some words, especially verbs that originally come from Latin â€“ make us sound much too formal.
127599	Andre used quite a few of these â€“ for example he said <strong>abandon</strong> the day.
132799	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yeah - abandon the day. Well, to sound more natural, Andre could use a multi-word verb instead, and say he<strong> gave up on </strong>the day.
142478	Now, <strong>give up on something</strong> has a very similar meaning to <strong>abandon</strong> in Andreâ€™s sentence â€“ they both mean <strong>stop doing something, because youâ€™re not succeeding</strong>.
153400	And Andre stopped hoping he would find his friends. Poor Andre.
157469	<strong>Rob<br></strong>So,<strong> give up on</strong> is a phrasal verb. In English, these are made up of verbs and prepositions.
164608	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yep, so, weâ€™ve got the verb <strong>give</strong> and the prepositions <strong>up</strong> and <strong>on</strong>.
169679	And Andre needs to use more of these phrasal verbs when heâ€™s speaking.
174128	<strong>Rob<br> </strong>So, are we saying that these Latinate verbs are wrong? Or not as good as the multi-word verbs?
180102	Can we forget about learning Latinate verbs then?
182960	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, that would be good, Rob. But, actually no, you do need to learn them and theyâ€™re not wrong: itâ€™s just a question of context.
190990	Youâ€™ll see a lot more of the Latinate verbs in written English and in formal English, so yep,&nbsp;you do&nbsp;need to learn both types, and use the right one in the right situation.
202398	So, for example, Andre said he said he planned to <strong>rendezvous</strong> with friends.
207716	Now, if he changes the Latin <strong>rendezvous</strong> to <strong>meet up with</strong>, the meaning doesnâ€™t really change, it just makes his speaking sound more natural.
217946	<strong>Rob<br></strong>OK, well, letâ€™s listen to one more example.
221326	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Andre<br></strong>I think they just invented a story!
224406	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>This would sound better as <strong>I think they just</strong> <strong>made up a story</strong>.
229821	When you <strong>make something up</strong>, you say something that isnâ€™t true.
233744	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And now, letâ€™s listen to Andre again, this time with the multi-word verbsâ€¦
239012	<strong>INSERT<br> Andre<br> </strong>I wanted to <strong>meet up with</strong> friends at the shopping centre, but I couldnâ€™t find them.
244992	In the end, I <strong>gave up on</strong> the day. They said they couldnâ€™t find me, but I think they just <strong>made up</strong> a story!
254905	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done Andre. Thatâ€™s a lot better.

264862	<strong>Rob<br></strong>And now itâ€™s quiz time! What goes in this gap?
268675	Iâ€™m going to ______ my family next weekend.
272924	Is it a) meet on with b) meet up to or c) meet up with?
279328	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>The verb is c) meet up with.
282279	Number 2. My brother isnâ€™t very reliable.
286184	Heâ€™s always a) making on excuses b) making up excuses or c) inventing up excuses.
295988	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Heâ€™s alwaysâ€¦ b) making up excuses. And number 3.
301422	What multi-word verb has a similar meaning to the verb <strong>abandon</strong>?
305497	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: <strong>give up on</strong>.
307753	Well done if you got those right at home. That brings us almost to the end of todayâ€™s programme.
315856	<strong>Rob<br></strong>But before we go, hereâ€™s todayâ€™s top tip for learning vocabulary: try to learn phrasal verbs and their Latin-based partners in pairs.
324512	That way, youâ€™ll have the right verb for the right situation.
328025	So, weâ€™re almost out of time, but Catherine very quickly can you remind us of some of these multi-word verbs weâ€™ve heard today?
333374	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Most certainly. We had <strong>look into</strong>, <strong>made up of</strong>, <strong>find out about</strong>, <strong>meet up with</strong>, <strong>give up on</strong> and <strong>made up</strong>.
344471	<strong>Rob<br></strong>Thanks. Very useful. Thereâ€™s more about this at BBC learning English dot com.
