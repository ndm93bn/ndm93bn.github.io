1	(Introduction...)
12333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Neil.
16633	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And Iâ€™m Sophie. Hi, Neil, Iâ€™ve got a question for you.
20800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>OKâ€¦
22000	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Whatâ€™s black and white and read all over?
25888	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Whatâ€™s black and white, and red all over? I donâ€™t know that. Go on, tell meâ€¦
34555	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>A newspaper.
35999	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh â€“ I seeâ€¦ so it wasn't the colour red, but read [/red/] as in the past form of read [/ri:d/].
44222	White paper, black writing and the â€˜read all overâ€™ bit means people read it. Very good, Sophie. You should go into comedy.
52900	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Iâ€™m not too sure about that, Neil. Sorry for the bad joke everyone, but words that sound the same but have different meanings is actually our topic for todayâ€™s show.
62811	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right â€“ homophones, words that sound the same but have different spellings and different meaningsâ€¦ Letâ€™s listen to Mark and Jane.
73111	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Markâ€™s just had an accident in the kitchen.
75777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And hereâ€™s a question for you to think about while you listen: what has Mark got on his jeans?
83111	<strong>INSERT</strong> <br><strong>Jane<br></strong>Whatâ€™s wrong, Mark? You look really angry.
85674	<strong>Mark<br></strong>Whatâ€™s wrong, Jane?! Canâ€™t you see? Iâ€™ve got flour all over my jeans.
91444	<strong>Jane<br></strong>Youâ€™ve got a flower on your jeans? I didnâ€™t know you liked pretty thingsâ€¦
96111	<strong>Mark<br></strong>Not a flower, Jane. Flour! Look.
101933	<strong>Jane<br></strong>Ahh, Mark! Youâ€™re making me a birthday cake. Ahhâ€¦
106999	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, thatâ€™s Mark and Jane.
109777	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And we asked you what Mark had got on his jeans.
113222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And of course, the answer was <strong>flour</strong>.
116491	The kind of flour you use to make bread and cakes.
120000	And <strong>flour</strong> is spelt <strong>f-l-o-u-r</strong>.
125777	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Jane thought it was a different kind of <strong>flower</strong>, f-l-o-w-e-r, the brightly coloured and sweet-smelling plant you might have in your garden.
137000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right, <strong>flour</strong>, f-l-o-u-r, and <strong>flower</strong>, f-l-o-w-e-r, are homophones â€“ words that sound the same, but have different spellings and different meanings.
154922	Now, homophones can be difficult to learn, and the reason is because they sound exactly the same.
161900	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. And here are some more examplesâ€¦
165222	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Mail</strong>, m-a-i-l, meaning letters and parcels you send in the post, and <strong>male</strong>, m-a-l-e, the opposite of female.
181665	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And hereâ€™s another one: <strong>right</strong>, r-i-g-h-t, the opposite of left, and <strong>write</strong>, w-r-i-t-e, like write a letter.
196100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Hereâ€™s one: <strong>peace</strong>, p-e-a-c-e, when itâ€™s quiet and calm, and <strong>piece</strong>, p-i-e-c-e, a part of something â€“ a piece of cake!
213900	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And one more: <strong>tail</strong>, t-a-i-l, the long, narrow part that sticks out of the back of an animal's body and <strong>tale</strong>, t-a-l-e, a kind of story.
228204	Whatâ€™s your favourite fairy tale, Neil?
231000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I really like The Emperorâ€™s New Clothes. I think itâ€™s really relevant still today. Even for grown-ups.
240188	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Itâ€™s a great story.
241444	<strong>IDENT<br></strong>Youâ€™re listening to bbclearningenglish.com.
246900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about homophones.
249444	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Thatâ€™s words which are spelt differently and have different meanings, but sound the same.
254777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And now itâ€™s time for a quiz. Iâ€™m going to read a sentence with one of the homophones from todayâ€™s show.
262623	Try to spell the word correctly as you listen and Sophie will tell you the answers afterwards.
268922	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Good luck!
270000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Are you ready? Number one. <strong>Ben gave his girlfriend a flower for Valentineâ€™s Day</strong>.
278333	Now how do you spell <strong>flower</strong> there?
282111	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>Unless she wanted to bake bread, he gave her a <strong>flower, f-l-o-w-e-r</strong>.
289777	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Correct. Well done if you got that one right.
292646	Number two. <strong>The dog is wagging its tail</strong>.
296955	How do you spell <strong>tail</strong>?
299000	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>This is part of an animalâ€™s body, so itâ€™s <strong>t-a-i-l</strong>.
304500	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And well done if you got that one at home.
307111	Finally:<strong> The postman put the letters on the table on the right.</strong>
313000	How do you spell <strong>right</strong>?
315111	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>The tableâ€™s on the <strong>right</strong>, not on the left, so itâ€™s <strong>r-i-g-h-t</strong>.
323222	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well done to everyone at home who got those right.
326301	<strong>Sophie<br></strong>And that almost brings us to the end of the programme.
329410	But before we go, hereâ€™s todayâ€™s top tip for learning vocabulary.
334236	Homophones are difficult to spell correctly when you hear them because they sound the same.
340444	So, if you think a word might be a homophone, read or listen to the words around it very carefully.
348121	That will help you get a better idea what word it is and how to spell it.
353333	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thereâ€™s more about homophones at bbclearningenglish.com.
