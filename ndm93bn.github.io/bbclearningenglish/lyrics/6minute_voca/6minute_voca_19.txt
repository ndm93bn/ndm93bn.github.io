1	(Introduction...)
12100	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherine.
16100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And me, Neil. And today we're talking about ordinal numbers.
22800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes. So numbers like <strong>first, second </strong>and <strong>third</strong>.
27600	So let's start by listening to Laurence. He's talking about his 18th birthday party.
33466	While you listen, try to answer this question: What date was his party? Here's Laurence.
40700	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>Laurence<br></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives!
47500	It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party.
54400	It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel.
57977	The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!
67000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So we asked you: What date was Laurence's birthday party?
71200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is: <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May.
73800	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That's right. Now <strong>the twenty-fifth</strong> is an ordinal number like <strong>the</strong> <strong>first</strong> and <strong>the</strong> <strong>second</strong>.
80660	Ordinal numbers tell us the position of something in a group - the dates in a month, for example.
86800	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Or which birthday it is. Laurence said it was his <strong>eighteenth</strong> birthday.
91900	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, he did. Lucky him! And ordinal numbers are different to cardinal numbers.
97100	We use cardinal numbers like <strong>one</strong>, <strong>two</strong>, <strong>three</strong> for counting and to answer the question <strong>how many</strong>.
105000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And to make a cardinal number into an ordinal number, add the letters <strong>t-h</strong> to the end of the cardinal number.
113550	<strong>Eighteen - eighteenth; sixty - sixtieth.
119900	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And that works for all the cardinal numbers except for <strong>first, second </strong>and<strong> third</strong> â€“ they're irregular, but for all the others, it's add <strong>t-h, </strong>so that's<strong> fourth, fifth, sixth, seventhâ€¦</strong>
137609	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Eighth, ninth, tenth</strong>.
141114	So that's good but in writing we do have a couple of irregular spellings, such as <strong>fifth:</strong>
149800	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>f-i-f-t-h</strong>
152600	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>eighth</strong>
153705	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>e-i-g-h-t-h</strong>
158200	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>ninth</strong>
159600	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>n-i-n-t-h</strong>
162400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>twelfth</strong>
163624	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>t-w-e-l-f-t-h</strong>
166999	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And for numbers ending in<strong> -y </strong>like <strong>sixty</strong>, drop the <strong>-y</strong> and add <strong>-i-e </strong>and<strong> -t-h </strong>to make<strong> sixtieth:</strong>
176700	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>s-i-x-t-i-e-t-h</strong>
181966	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now let's look more closely at dates. Listen for the date in this clip.
187300	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>It was on <strong>the twenty-fifth of</strong> May and it was <strong>the first</strong> time that I've ever had a big party.
195300	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>The twenty-fifth of May</strong>. When we say the day before the month, we always use the words <strong>the</strong> and <strong>of</strong>: <strong>the twenty-fifth of May</strong>.
207400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But when we say the month before the day, we don't use the word <strong>of</strong>. It's just <strong>May the twenty-fifth.
216100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>We often use the word <strong>the </strong>with ordinal numbers, but we can also use possessives.
221800	In this next clip, Laurence uses the possessive adjective <strong>my</strong> before <strong>eighteenth</strong>.
227400	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>For my <strong>18th </strong>birthday last year, I invited about sixty friends and relatives!
234500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Let's have another clip.
236900	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 3<br></strong>It was in a restaurant on <strong>the third</strong> floor of a hotel.
240663	The food was really delicious and I won <strong>second</strong> prize in the dancing competition!
247000	<strong>Neil<br></strong>So, now we have two more ways of using ordinal numbers: space and quality.
253500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, we do. And <strong>the third floor</strong> tells us about the position of the floors in space.
259570	It's the same as when we give directions, for example: <strong>Take the second left after the traffic lights.
265600	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And <strong>second prize</strong> tells us about the quality.
268702	And a point to make here is that ordinal numbers can be used as adjectives and adverbs without <strong>the.
275200	</strong>Like in the phrase <strong>he won second prize. Second </strong>is an adjective.
