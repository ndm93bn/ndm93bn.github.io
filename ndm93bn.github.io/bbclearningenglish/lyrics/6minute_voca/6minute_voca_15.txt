14317	<strong>Neil</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Neil â€¦
17945	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And Iâ€™m Catherine. And our topic today is business jargon â€“ thatâ€™s words and phrases you hear mostly in the world of business.
26268	So Neil, are you ready for some <strong>blue-sky thinking</strong>?
30100	<strong>Rob<br></strong><strong>Blue-sky thinking</strong> â€“ thatâ€™s an expression often heard in the workplace.
35398	It means <strong>being creative</strong> â€“ coming up with new, original ideas.
40514	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly, and in this programme weâ€™ve got lots more business phrases for you.
44907	Weâ€™ll explain what they mean and when to use them.
49159	<strong>Neil<br></strong>But first, listen to Sophie, talking to her marketing team.
53959	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And hereâ€™s a question to think about while you listen: What does Sophie ask Joe to do?
61003	<strong>INSERT<br></strong>Good: it seems weâ€™re all <strong>reading from the same page</strong>.
64520	We need to reach the <strong>upscale</strong> customers.
67500	So, can we <strong>think out of the box</strong> and come up with something quite different?
72292	We have to <strong>push the envelope </strong>if we want to succeed in the market.
77259	Now, if we take <strong>the helicopter view</strong>, we can see that weâ€™ve <strong>effected</strong> lower costs.
82473	Weâ€™ve targeted <strong>low-hanging fruit </strong>and got rid of several distributers.
87071	<strong>Going forward </strong>now, Joe, can you <strong>action</strong> advertising? Is everyone clear now?
96049	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Lots of business jargon there. We usually donâ€™t use so many at one time, do we Neil?
101655	<strong>Neil<br></strong>No, it can sound a bit much if you use all of them.
104938	Though these are things you probably will hear in a business context.
108789	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Most definitely. So back to our question.
111118	We asked you: What does Sophie asked Joe to do?
114704	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is: She asks him to <strong>action</strong> advertising.
119178	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Thatâ€™s right. She wants him to deal with advertising.
122367	Sophie used the noun <strong>action </strong>as a verb â€“ more on that later.
126845	But first letâ€™s look at some jargon she used to talk about having new ideas. Hereâ€™s a clip.
133411	<strong>INSERT CLIP 1<br></strong>So, can we <strong>think out of the box</strong> and come up with something quite different?
137922	We have to <strong>push the envelope </strong>if we want to succeed in the market<strong>.
143012	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So Sophie wants her team to come up with a new and exciting idea.
147335	And she uses the expression <strong>think out of the box</strong>, which means <strong>be creative; donâ€™t feel limited to the same old ideas</strong>.
155897	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And she tells them to <strong>push the envelope</strong>,which means <strong>go further than before; do things that might be new or risky</strong>.
164037	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, thatâ€™s similar to that expression we had earlier â€“ <strong>blue-sky thinking</strong>, which means <strong>being creative â€“ coming up with new and original ideas, even if they are not very practical or realistic</strong>.
175755	So Neil, are you a <strong>blue-sky thinker</strong>?
179630	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Oh, yes, of course, Iâ€™m incredible creative, you know.
183570	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I do. Yes, thatâ€™s true.
185100	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Sophie also said everyone was <strong>reading from the same page</strong>.
190847	Now this expression means they all<strong> had similar ideas and agreed with each other.</strong>Hereâ€™s another clip.
198052	<strong>INSERT CLIP 2<br></strong>Now if we <strong>take the helicopter view</strong>, we can see that weâ€™ve <strong>effected</strong> lower costs.
203690	Weâ€™ve targeted <strong>low-hanging fruit</strong> and got rid of several distributers.
208408	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Some interesting phrases there, and you can guess their meaning if you actually picture what the words mean.
214860	For example, <strong>take the helicopter view</strong>.
217578	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. Now, picture yourself up in the sky in a helicopter and youâ€™re looking down at the ground â€“ and you can see a lot more from up there than you can see when youâ€™re down on the ground.
229437	So this expression means: <strong>looking at the whole situation and not just one or two details</strong>.
235375	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Sophie also said that theyâ€™d lowered costs by targeting <strong>low-hanging fruit</strong>.
241071	<strong>Low-hanging fruit</strong> means <strong>the easiest, or most obvious, things</strong>.
245798	In reality, on a fruit tree, the fruit that hangs low down is easier to pick, so thereâ€™s a link between this idea and the idiomatic meaning of the phrase in a business situation.
257577	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. Now, Sophie used two nouns as verbs: <strong>effect</strong> and <strong>action</strong>.
263667	She said: <strong>Weâ€™ve effected lower costs</strong>.
266996	And <strong>to</strong> <strong>effect</strong> means <strong>to achieve something</strong>.
270278	She also asked Joe to <strong>action</strong> advertising, this means she wants him to deal with the advertising.
278194	And nouns used as verbs like this sound very strong. They give the speakerâ€™s ideas greater force.
286117	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Sophie used the word <strong>upscale</strong> to describe customers.
290465	<strong>Upscale </strong>describes people with money or things that are high quality.
295112	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I often think that we could do with some <strong>upscale </strong>coffee in our office.
299008	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Thatâ€™s a good idea.

307984	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>And itâ€™s time for a quiz.
310355	Number one: If I want you to be creative and original, would I tell you to a) <strong>push the envelope</strong> or b) target<strong> low-hanging fruit</strong>?
319784	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is a)<strong> push the envelope.
323133	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Well done if you got that right.
324830	Number two: If I want you to look at the wider picture and not concentrate on detail, would I tell you to a) <strong>think out of the box</strong> or b) <strong>take the helicopter view</strong>?
337219	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And itâ€™s b) <strong>take the helicopter view.
341320	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Good. And finally, if I want you to do something, would I ask you to: a) <strong>action </strong>it or b) <strong>effect</strong> it.
349007	<strong>Neil</strong><br>And the answer is a)<strong> action</strong>.
351500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done if you got those right.
353474	And before we go, hereâ€™s a top tip for learning vocabulary: when you learn new words, make a picture in your head of the meaning.
360979	And when you hear or see the word again, you can think of the picture.
