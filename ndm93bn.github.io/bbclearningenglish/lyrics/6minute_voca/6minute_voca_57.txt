1	(Introduction...)
12700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me Finn.
17788	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>...and me Catherine. And in this programme we're talking about the letters <strong>o-u-g-h.
25500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, the letters <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>are found in lots of English words including <strong>cough</strong>,<strong> rough</strong>,<strong> ought </strong>and<strong> through</strong>, but there are lots of different pronunciations.
39999	So let's start with George. He's talking about last winter, when he was ill.
47400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And think about this question while you listen: What did George do in February?
53800	<strong>INSERT<br> George<br></strong>Last winter I had a <strong>cough</strong> for <strong>roughly</strong> three months.
57900	By February, I <strong>thought </strong>I <strong>ought</strong> to go to the doctor.
61605	He gave me a <strong>thorough</strong> check and some medicine.
64900	It got better in the end, <strong>although</strong> the <strong>cough</strong> lasted right <strong>through</strong> till April.
69706	I'm so glad spring's here!
72700	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Poor George. And we asked: what did George do in February?
77333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well, George <strong>thought</strong> that he <strong>ought </strong>to go to the doctor. So that's what he did.
82141	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Good. Now the words <strong>thought</strong>, spelt <strong>t-h-o-u-g-h-t </strong>and <strong>ought</strong>, spelt <strong>o-u-g-h-t,</strong> both have the <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>pattern in them and it's pronounced <strong>or</strong>.
97732	<strong>Thought, ought</strong>.
100720	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Thought,<strong> ought</strong>.
103600	And there are more <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> verbs with the same pronunciation, like <strong>fought</strong>, the past of <strong>fight</strong>, and <strong>bought</strong>, the past of <strong>buy</strong>.
114900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>...and <strong>brought</strong>,<strong> b-r-o-u-g-h-t</strong>, the past of <strong>bring</strong>.
120900	People sometimes confuse <strong>bought </strong>and <strong>brought</strong> so Catherine, can you give us an example sentence with both words?
129500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>I <strong>bought</strong> a new TV from the hypermarket and I <strong>brought</strong> it home in a taxi.
136391	Now let's have another clip. And how <strong>o-u-g-h </strong>words are there in this one?
142700	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>George<br></strong>Last winter I had a <strong>cough</strong> for <strong>roughly</strong> three months.
146815	<strong>Finn<br> </strong>So there were two <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> words there: <strong>Cough</strong>:<strong> c-o-u-g-h</strong> and <strong>roughly</strong>:<strong> r-o-u-g-h-l-y</strong>.
158500	<strong>Roughly</strong> means <strong>about</strong>, so George had a <strong>cough</strong> for about - or <strong>roughly</strong> - three months.
166500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>But the pronunciation of these two words is different.
170100	The <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in<strong> cough</strong> sounds like <strong>off</strong>. <strong> Off</strong>,<strong> cough</strong>.
176900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in<strong> roughly</strong> sounds like <strong>uff</strong>. <strong> Uff</strong>,<strong> roughly</strong>.
184500	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Right. So we're beginning to see that there is no real rule for pronouncing these words, Finn.
190300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Sadly not, that's right. You are just going to have to learn to spell and say each word on its own.
197401	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>OK. Let's have another clip.
199700	<strong>INSERT<br>George<br></strong>He gave me a <strong>thorough</strong> check.
202300	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the<strong> o-u-g-h </strong>word there was <strong>thorough</strong>:<strong> t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h</strong>.
210779	It means <strong>very careful and exact</strong>.
213995	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the pronunciation is different again. Listen to this one: <strong>thorough</strong>.
219500	It's an <strong>uh </strong>sound at the end of the word.
223059	<strong> Uh</strong>,<strong> thorough</strong>, <strong>uh</strong>,<strong> thorough.
227306	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Here's one more clip.
229600	<strong>INSERT<br>George<br></strong>I got better in the end, <strong>although</strong> the cough lasted right <strong>through</strong> till April.
234900	<strong>Finn<br></strong>This time we heard <strong>although</strong> spelt<strong> a-l-t-h-o-u-g-h</strong> and <strong>through, </strong>spelt<strong> t-h-r-o-u-g-h</strong>.
246903	Now the <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in <strong>although, </strong>sounds like <strong>oh</strong>.<strong> Although</strong>.
253613	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And in<strong> through</strong>, it sounds like <strong>ooo</strong>. <strong>Through</strong>.
258100	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So you know what, that gives us six different pronunciations for the letters <strong>o-u-g-h</strong>.
265270	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>That's right, six of them. We had: <strong>thought</strong>,<strong> cough</strong>,<strong> roughly</strong>,<strong> thorough</strong>,<strong> although </strong>and <strong>through</strong>.
274500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So in fact there are more than six pronunciations for <strong>o-u-g-h</strong> in the English language, but these are the most common ones.
