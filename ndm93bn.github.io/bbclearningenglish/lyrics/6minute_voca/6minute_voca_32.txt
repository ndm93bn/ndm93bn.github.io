1	(Introduction...)
12500	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Hello! Welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary. Iâ€™m Finn.
16333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And Iâ€™m Catherine. In this programme, weâ€™re talking about misspelt words.
21333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Let's start by listening to Marcus. He's talking about his last holiday.
27400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And hereâ€™s a question for while youâ€™re listening: What was the weather like on Marcusâ€™s holiday?
33333	<strong>INSERT</strong> <br><strong>Marcus<br></strong>Last year we decided to have a <strong>foreign</strong> holiday.
36444	We <strong>travelled</strong> by coach to Rome and the <strong>scenery</strong> in northern Italy was beautiful.
41777	Our hotel <strong>accommodation</strong> was great, and we had some <strong>wonderful</strong> meals in <strong>restaurants</strong>.
47000	The weather was a bit <strong>changeable</strong> until the third day but it didnâ€™t matter.
51666	We got to <strong>practise</strong> our Italian and itâ€™s a lot better now.
55666	The whole thing was a great <strong>experience</strong>.
58555	<strong>STING</strong>
64222	<strong>Finn<br></strong>We asked you: What was the weather like on Marcusâ€™s holiday?
68777	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is that the weather was a bit <strong>changeable</strong> and that brings us to our first common spelling mistake.
75934	<strong>Changeable</strong> is spelt <strong>c-h-a-n-g-E-a-b-l-e</strong>.
83444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Yes, there are quite a lot of words with the letters <strong>g-e</strong> in them, and the <strong>e</strong> shows that the <strong>g</strong> is pronounced softly as /dÊ’/, chan<strong>ge</strong>able.
95000	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Other examples of words with <strong>g-e</strong> in the middle are <strong>manageable, management, knowledgeable </strong>and <strong>acknowledgement.
107266	And they all have the <strong>e</strong> after the <strong>g</strong>. But what other words with tricky spellings did we hear? Listen.
115444	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1 <br></strong>Last year we decided to have a <strong>foreign</strong> holiday.
118444	We <strong>travelled</strong> by coach to Rome and the <strong>scenery</strong> in northern Italy was beautiful.
123699	Our hotel <strong>accommodation</strong> was great, and we had some <strong>wonderful</strong> meals in <strong>restaurants</strong>.
129111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Now the spelling of<strong> foreign </strong>is interesting.
132222	Thereâ€™s a spelling rule that says you must put <strong>i</strong> before <strong>e</strong> except after <strong>c</strong>.
139008	And thatâ€™s a really good rule for lots of words.
141666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Like <strong>believe</strong>, spelt <strong>b-e-l-I-E-v-e</strong> and <strong>receive </strong>spelt <strong>r-e-c-E-I-v-e</strong>.
150800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Exactly. Or <strong>field </strong>spelt <strong>f-i-e-l-d</strong> but <strong>ceiling</strong>, with a c, <strong>c-e-i-l-i-n-g.
161888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Yes, so<strong> foreign</strong> breaks the rule, doesnâ€™t it?&nbsp; Itâ€™s spelt <strong>f-o-r-e-i-g-n</strong>. And thereâ€™s no letter <strong>c </strong>there.
170333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>No, thatâ€™s an exception. And there are a few others like<strong> leisure </strong>and <strong>weird.
177000	They both have<strong> e-i -</strong>but not after a<strong> c.</strong> Itâ€™s really worth learning these.
182700	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>What other tricky spellings were there in that clip? We heard<strong> travelled.
187009	</strong>How many <strong>l</strong>s are there in travelled?
190908	<strong>Finn<br></strong>There are two. In British English, with verbs that end in a vowel before <strong>l</strong> or <strong>r</strong>, we double the final consonants when we make them into past or continuous forms.
204555	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Finally there were three nouns that can cause spelling problems. What were they, Catherine?
210333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>They were be <strong>scenery, accommodation</strong> and <strong>restaurants</strong>.
215110	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>Scenery </strong>starts with an<strong> s </strong>sound, but it is spelt with<strong> s-c .</strong>
221299	Itâ€™s easy to forget the <strong>c </strong>because you donâ€™t hear it.
225197	The words <strong>science</strong> and <strong>scissors</strong> are the same.
229222	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Now <strong>accommodation </strong>has a double <strong>c </strong>and a double <strong>m</strong> and <strong>restaurant</strong> has the letters <strong>au</strong> in the middle.
237777	No rule for these Iâ€™m afraid! They just have to be learnt. Next clip!
243131	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>We got to <strong>practise</strong> our Italian and itâ€™s a lot better now.
246999	The whole thing was a great <strong>experience.
249800	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So how do you spell the verb <strong>practise</strong>?
252888	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So the verb <strong>practise </strong>&nbsp;is <strong>p-r-a-c-t-i-S-e</strong>.
259888	It ends in <strong>s-e</strong> not <strong>c-e.</strong>
264000	Thatâ€™s a very common mistake because the noun<strong> practice </strong>is spelt with <strong>i-c-e </strong>at the end.
271333	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And finally we heard<strong> experience. </strong>Now is that<strong> e-n-c-e </strong>or<strong> a-n-c-e </strong>at the end?
281400	<strong>Catherine<br></strong><strong>Experience</strong> ends in <strong>e-n-c-e</strong>.
285666	Whereas <strong>performance</strong> ends in <strong>a-n-c-e</strong>.
290444	And yet again &nbsp;thereâ€™s no rule for these spellings. You just have to check them and learn them.
296952	<strong>IDENT</strong>
302666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And itâ€™s quiz time!
305555	Number one. My sisterâ€™s new babyâ€™s very loveable.
311222	But how do you spell <strong>loveable</strong>?
314666	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Itâ€™s<strong> l-o-v-e-a-b-l-e. </strong>Not forgetting the <strong>e</strong> in the middle.
322333	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Youâ€™re right! Now question two: The word <strong>ancient</strong> â€“ meaning very old - does not follow the usual rule.
330900	Can you spell it?
334444	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Ancient is <strong>a-n-c-i-e-n-t</strong>.
340966	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly, and question three: How many<strong> l</strong>s are there in <strong>quarrelling</strong>, meaning arguing?
350111	<strong>Finn<br></strong>The answerâ€™s two<strong> l</strong>s<strong>.
352666	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Double <strong>l</strong>, thatâ€™s correct, well done.&nbsp; And well done if you got those right at home.
