13025	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Hello! And welcome to 6 Minute Vocabulary with me, Catherineâ€¦
16957	<strong>Finn<br></strong>â€¦and me Finn. In this programme, weâ€™re looking at spelling.
21836	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the area of spelling weâ€™re looking at today is words with double letters.
26411	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Letâ€™s start by listening to David.
29345	Heâ€™s a student welfare officer at a university.
33624	Heâ€™s welcoming a new student to the campus.
36559	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And while you listen to David, hereâ€™s a question for you.
40026	<strong>Finn<br></strong>What word means: the rooms, flats and houses that people live in? Hereâ€™s David.
46995	<strong>INSERT<br></strong><strong>David<br></strong>Congratulations on <strong>getting </strong>a place at our university.
51657	Itâ€™s a <strong>brilliant opportunity </strong>and Iâ€™m sure that you will&nbsp;be<strong> happy </strong>and <strong>successful </strong>here.
58102	Iâ€™m here to help you find <strong>accommodation</strong>.
61038	Weâ€™ve got rooms, flats and houses all over the city, but I <strong>recommend </strong>that you <strong>apply</strong> as soon as<strong> possible</strong> so youâ€™re not <strong>disappointed</strong>.
72159	Hereâ€™s a list of <strong>addresses</strong>.
74664	<strong>STING</strong>
78125	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>David there. And we asked: whatâ€™s the word for rooms, flats and houses that people live in?
84399	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And the answer is: <strong>accommodation</strong>.
87558	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>It is and <strong>accommodation </strong>is one of our words with double letters.
92022	So, Finn do you spell accommodation?
94996	<strong>Finn<br></strong><strong>a-double c-o-double m-o-d-a-t-i-o-n</strong>.
101599	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Well done, Finn. Now listen to this clip.
104544	Which 6 words have double letters?
107996	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 1 <br></strong>Congratulations on <strong>getting </strong>a place at our University.
112180	Itâ€™s a <strong>brilliant opportunity </strong>and Iâ€™m sure that you will be<strong> happy </strong>and <strong>successful </strong>here!
118533	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So we had <strong>getting â€“ </strong>with <strong>double t</strong>,<strong> brilliant </strong>with<strong> double l, opportunity </strong>with <strong>double p</strong>,<strong> will </strong>with<strong> double l</strong>, and also<strong>&nbsp;happy </strong>with <strong>double p</strong> and <strong>successful â€“ </strong>with <strong>double c</strong> and <strong>double s</strong>.
138945	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Correct! Let's take a look at some spelling rules. The first rule is about verbs.
146190	If the final three letters of a verb are consonant, vowel, consonant, we double the final consonant before we add <strong>i-n-g</strong> or <strong>e-d</strong>.
159400	So <strong>get, </strong>spelt <strong>g-e-t </strong>becomes <strong>getting</strong> with double t, and <strong>begin</strong> ends in <strong>g-i-n</strong> so it becomes <strong>beginning </strong>with <strong>double n</strong>.
174306	Now our next rule is to do with short vowel sounds.
178444	Finn can you demonstrate some short vowel sounds please?
183400	<strong>Finn<br></strong>a, o, i, e, a, u.
190009	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Fantastic. That's enough, thank you.
192953	And now some long vowel sounds?
195952	<strong>Finn<br></strong>u, e, a, ei.
204909	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Ok, so, when there is a <strong>short</strong> vowel sound before a consonant, like <strong>a</strong> in <strong>happy, </strong>we often double the consonant after it.
215002	The <strong>short a</strong> in <strong>happy</strong> gives us a <strong>double p</strong>.
219605	The short <strong>o </strong>in<strong> opportunity</strong> gives us another<strong> double p, </strong>the short<strong> i </strong>in<strong> brilliant </strong>gives us <strong>double l.
228988	<strong>Finn<br></strong>And this can happen more than once in the same word.
233134	So in the word<strong> successful</strong>, we get <strong>u</strong> <strong>double</strong> <strong>c</strong> and <strong>e double s</strong>, and in <strong>accommodation</strong> we get <strong>a double c</strong> and <strong>o double m. Easy!
247703	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>Exactly. And lots of short words like <strong>summer, coffee </strong>and<strong> apple</strong> and <strong>will</strong> follow this general rule.
255255	<strong>Finn<br></strong>So letâ€™s listen to another clip and put this general rule to the test. Listen carefullyâ€¦
262667	<strong>INSERT 1 CLIP 2<br></strong>But I <strong>recommend </strong>that you apply as soon as<strong> possible</strong> so youâ€™re not <strong>disappointed</strong>.
269008	Hereâ€™s a list of <strong>addresses</strong> â€¦
271692	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>So: following the rule, weâ€™ve got <strong>recommend</strong> with <strong>o double m</strong>, <strong>possible</strong> with <strong>o double s</strong> and <strong>disappointed</strong> with <strong>a double p</strong>.

290915	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And weâ€™re talking about words with double letters.
294075	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Right, quiz time! Number one: Is there a double <strong>n </strong>in the verb <strong>happening</strong>?
301530	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>No, there isnâ€™t.
302834	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Well done! Number two: Are there any double letters in the word <strong>immediately</strong>?
309278	<strong>Catherine</strong><br>Yes, thereâ€™s a <strong>double</strong> <strong>m</strong>.
311006	<strong>Finn<br></strong>Very good! Number three: Which of these words have a <strong>double c</strong>?
316455	<strong>occasion, accident, succeed</strong>?
320992	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And the answer is â€“ they all do!
323333	They all have a short vowel sound followed by a&nbsp;<strong>double c</strong>. That's a Finn trick question.
329744	<strong>Finn<br></strong>It was indeed. And thatâ€™s the end of the quiz.
332551	Youâ€™re <strong>brilliant</strong> with <strong>double l</strong> if you got all of those questions right!
338064	<strong>Catherine<br></strong>And now hereâ€™s a top tip for vocabulary learning.
341249	If youâ€™re struggling to learn the spelling of a word, get a keyboard and type it a hundred times.
347279	Your fingers might learn the spelling more quickly than your brain! What do you think Finn â€“ would that work for you?
353162	<strong>Finn<br></strong>My fingers are much quicker than my brain, Catherine! It's a good idea, a very good tip.
