1	Introduction...
11549	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.
14451	I'm Alice.
15272	<strong>Rob</strong><br>And I'm Rob.
16317	<strong>Alice</strong><br>You look very pale, Rob.
18632	Are you OK?
19741	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, I was at a rather boozy wedding party last night.
23069	And I had a bit too much champagne.
25224	Do you know any good hangover cures?
28253	<strong>Alice</strong><br>A<strong> hangover</strong> is the headache and sickness you can feel after drinking too much alcohol.
33683	And a <strong>cure</strong> is something that makes you better.
36915	Well, I'm <strong>teetotal</strong> - I don't drink alcohol.
39987	So, I'd say the best hangover cure is not to drink in the first place.
44339	<strong>Rob</strong><br>You don't believe in hair of the dog then?
47037	<strong>Alice</strong><br>No, Rob, I don't.
48680	<strong>Hair of the dog</strong> is the belief that drinking more alcohol when you already have a hangover will make you feel better!
55005	And <strong>boozy</strong> means lots of alcohol.
58312	<strong>Rob</strong><br>I can see I'm not going to get much sympathy from you.
61544	So I'm going to take a couple of painkillers and let you tell everyone what the subject of today's show is.
67219	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Alright then.
68040	Well, it's drinking too much, Rob.
70675	And I have a question for you.
72563	What is the name of the main process involved in producing alcohol?
77128	Is it.
77832	<br>a) fermentation?
79965	<br>b) hydration?
81864	<br>Or c) purification?
84328	<strong>Rob</strong><br>OK, I know it has something to do with water so I'm going to go for b) hydration.
88883	It rings a bell from chemistry lessons at school.
91890	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you were listening carefully in class, Rob.
96772	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, er. no comment.
98724	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Well, most people are aware of the links between smoking and cancer, but fewer are aware that drinking alcohol is linked to an increased risk of future health problems.
108932	The UK government is currently trying to raise awareness with their new guidelines on how much it's safe to drink.
115012	Let's hear what Dr Michael Moseley has to say about health risks.
119247	<strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Dr Michael Moseley, Science journalist and TV presenter</strong><br>Unfortunately whatever level of alcohol you are drinking it is likely to increase your risk of some forms of cancer, particularly breast cancer, but also other rarer forms of cancer like head, neck, and the throat.
133967	The rest are quite low at moderate drinking but they do rise rapidly.
138863	<strong>Rob</strong><br>So any drinking at all - even one small glass of wine with your evening meal - raises your risk of cancer?
146287	Is that right?
147535	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Yes.
148271	And the health risk increases with the amount you drink.
151663	<strong>Rob</strong><br>But I thought wine was supposed to be good for you?
154906	<strong>Alice</strong><br>It's a popular belief, but medical evidence doesn't seem to support this view.
159812	Let's listen to Dr Michael Moseley again on this.
163727	<strong>INSERT</strong><br><strong>Dr Michael Moseley, Science journalist and TV presenter</strong><br>Now there's long been this idea there is this marvellous stuff in red wine called 'resveratrol' which is said to reduce your risk of all sorts of things.
170519	Unfortunately the amount you'd have to consume would be so huge that the downsides of drinking red wine would swiftly overwhelm them.
180023	<strong>Rob</strong><br>And the<strong> downside</strong> of something means the disadvantages.
182551	Now Alice, what's your favourite tipple?
185015	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Well, I don't have one Rob because I'm teetotal, remember?
189015	A <strong>tipple</strong> is another way of saying 'an alcoholic drink'.
193473	I enjoy beetroot and kale smoothies with a dash of turmeric and ground pepper.
198711	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Kale?
199703	Yuk, that's disgusting!
201548	Now, a smoothie is a thick drink made of fruit or vegetables blended with milk or yogurt or water.
207948	Well, I like sweet stuff.
210135	maybe a banana smoothie with some honey, but beetroot and kale sounds disgusting!
215681	<strong>Alice</strong><br><strong>Don't knock it until you've tried it</strong>.
218071	And that means to try something before you criticize it.
221508	<strong>Rob</strong><br>OK, OK, but seriously.
223065	A glass of wine makes me happy and relaxed.
226095	And there are health studies that suggest being happy is good for your health.
230447	<strong>Alice</strong><br>That's true, but eating and drinking healthily makes me happy!
233775	Now moving on, it's important to put the risk of drinking alcohol.
238735	<strong>Rob</strong><br>or horrible vegetable smoothies.
240723	<strong>Alice</strong><br>in context. Statistically, drinking alcohol regularly represents just under 1% lifetime risk of death.
249129	But actually an hour of TV watching or eating a bacon sandwich a couple of times a week is more dangerous.
255977	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, that's what I like to hear!
257779	Though.
258825	what if I'm watching TV, enjoying a beer and a lovely bacon sandwich, does that triple my lifetime risk of death?
265843	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Well, Rob, you better ask Professor David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge that question.
272446	I was quoting him earlier about the TV watching and the bacon sandwich.
276467	He works with statistics, but this is for another programme.
280787	Now, let's get on to the serious matter of today's quiz question.
285480	I asked: What is the name of the main process involved in producing alcohol?
291113	Is it.
291838	a) fermentation, b) hydration or c) purification?
298611	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Well, I said b) hydration.
300489	Though you were <strong>sceptical</strong>, weren't you, Alice?
303187	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Yes.
303699	And I was right to be sceptical, which means 'doubtful', because b) is the wrong answer I'm afraid, Rob.
311315	The main process involved in producing alcohol is <strong>fermentation</strong>, which is the process in which yeast or bacteria changes sugar into alcohol.
322430	Hydration is the process of making your body absorb water.
327113	And purification is the act of removing some harmful things from something.
332147	Actually, have this glass of water, Rob.
335080	Hydration is a good hangover cure - much better than hair of the dog.
340595	<strong>Rob</strong><br>Cheers, Alice!
341928	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Now let's hear the words we learned today.
344457	<strong>Rob</strong><br>They are:<br>hangover<br>cure<br>teetotal<br>hair of the dog<br>boozy<br>downside<br>tipple<br>don't knock it until you've tried it<br>sceptical<br>fermentation
362537	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
365949	Keep hydrated and don't forget to join us again soon.
368936	<strong>Both</strong><br>Bye.
