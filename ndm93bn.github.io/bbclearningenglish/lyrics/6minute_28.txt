1	( Introduction... )
11690	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.
14573	<strong>Neil<br> </strong>And I'm Neil.
15409	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Have you ever played SimCity, Neil - the city-building computer game?
19366	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes, but I wasn't very good at it.
21757	I didn't build enough houses, which created a lot of homeless Sims - those are the characters in the game.
26889	And then I didn't deal effectively with a flood.
29733	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Really? Well, I suppose managing a city is quite a challenge - which is the subject of today's show: cities of the future - an important subject as so many of us now live in urban areas.
41882	I want to start with our quiz question: What is the percentage of the world's population that will be living in cities in 2050?
49545	We're dealing with approximates here.
51774	Is it. <br>a) 10%? <br>b) 50%? <br>Or c) 70%?
57695	<strong>Neil<br></strong>I think that it's a) 10%.
60214	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on in the show.
64080	Now, you've encountered a couple of issues that might face urban planners when designing a city, Neil - housing and dealing with a flood.
71499	Can you think of any others?
73090	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Yes. Having decent cycle lanes. Good transport networks are very important.
77490	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes indeed, and if people could get around easily on foot, or by bike, or by public transport, roads would be less <strong>congested</strong> - or overcrowded - and less polluted.
88113	That sounds rather utopian to me though.
90644	<strong>Neil<br></strong>A <strong>utopia</strong> is an imaginary place where everything is perfect.
94661	But Copenhagen is pretty utopian, Alice - the air is clean, there are bike lanes everywhere.
100228	<strong>Alice<br></strong>That sounds fantastic, but what about somewhere like Beijing with its constant <strong>smog</strong> - or air pollution - hanging over the city?
107566	A lot of people ride bikes there too.
109946	So which city is going to be the model for the future?
113243	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Maybe like the future Los Angeles in the movie <em>Blade Runner</em> - you know, glittering high-rises, gigantic neon billboards, flying cars.
121184	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Well, today's Los Angeles has terrible urban sprawl and traffic problems.
125468	<strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Urban sprawl</strong> is the way a city spreads into undeveloped land around it, often without planning permission.
132748	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Dr Janice Pearlman can explain why this happens.
135650	She is the founder and president of the Megacities Project non-profit organization in Rio de Janeiro and knows a lot about urban sprawl in Brazilian cities.
144904	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>Dr Janice Pearlman, founder and president of the Megacities Project non-profit organization, Rio de Janeiro<br></strong>People are coming massively into the cities which have no housing that's affordable to them. So they can't rent and they can't buy, and they end up building their own communities and houses on unoccupied land.
159138	And these communities are becoming in some places the majority not the minority and they're off the grid so they're not often serviced by either the social services but also many of them don't have water, sanitation and electricity.
175902	<strong>Neil<br></strong>People <strong>migrate</strong> - or move - from the countryside to the city to get better opportunities, but end up with nowhere to live.
184030	<strong>Alice<br></strong>So they build their own housing on unoccupied land.
187443	These <strong>shanty towns</strong> - poor communities where the houses are built out of cheap materials like corrugated iron and plastic sheeting - are often <strong>off the grid</strong>.
196240	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Which means they don't have an electricity or water supply - or access to healthcare and education.
202196	And these communities are growing, so the problem is getting bigger.
205807	So are there any solutions, Alice?
207804	<strong>Alice</strong><br>Well, it's all about improving the <strong>infrastructure</strong>.
211159	That's the basic facilities a town or city needs, for example: communication, transport, water, and electricity.
218822	But this shouldn't only mean improving housing conditions, but also promoting education and employment among the inhabitants, and building better communities.
227483	<strong>Neil<br></strong>That sounds like a real headache for the urban planners.
230443	<strong>Alice<br></strong>You're right there.
231453	And one thing urban planners are talking about at the moment is creating 'smart cities'.
237154	John Rossant, founder and chairman of the non-profit organisation New Cities Foundation, explains what it is.
243888	<strong>INSERT<br> </strong><strong>John Rossant, founder and chairman of the non-profit organisation New Cities Foundation, New York City<br></strong>I think, you know, generally it's accepted that cloud computing, ubiquitous internet, robust 5G networks etc, will transform our cities, whether they're in the global south or the developed world.
259782	And, you know, technology is really a game changer, I think, in urbanisation.
266283	<strong>Neil<br></strong>John Rossant there.
268594	What's <strong>ubiquitous</strong>, Alice?
270544	<strong>Alice<br></strong>It means available everywhere.
272611	So, the idea behind smart cities is to use technology to collect large amounts of data about how a city is performing.
280901	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And that will be a <strong>game changer</strong> - significantly affecting the way our cities function.
285870	Hope for the future, Alice?
287344	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Fingers crossed.
288586	Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil.
292673	I asked: What is the percentage of the world's population that will be living in cities in 2050?
298908	And remember I said we are dealing with approximates here?
302217	Is it.<br>a) 10%? <br>b) 50%? <br>Or c) 70%?
308416	<strong>Neil<br></strong>And I said a) 10%.
310506	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yes, and you underestimated there, Neil.
313339	The right answer is actually c) 70%.
317565	This, according to a report by the United Nations.
321199	Today 54% of the world's population lives in urban areas.
325483	<strong>Neil<br></strong>A lot really!
326238	<strong>Alice<br></strong>Yeah.
326772	<strong>Neil<br></strong>Well, I know we're running out of time, so let me repeat the words we learned today.
330731	They were:<br>congested<br>utopia<br>smog<br>urban sprawl<br>migrate<br>shanty towns<br>off the grid<br>infrastructure<br>ubiquitous<br>game changer
